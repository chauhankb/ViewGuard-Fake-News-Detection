1914947530,Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO,"Wed 05 Apr 2017 Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO. Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. ""Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents"" WHO said in a statement putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs. Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year. The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients and medicines such as Atropine an antidote for some types of chemical exposure and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia a Syrian ally and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. ""These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism"" Peter Salama Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said in the WHO statement. - REUTERS",nna,4/5/2017,idlib,0,wed 05 apr 2017 syria attack symptom consist nerv agent use victim suspect chemic attack syria appear show symptom consist reaction nerv agent world health organ said wednesday case appear show addit sign consist exposur organophosphoru chemic categori chemic includ nerv agent said statement put death toll least 70 unit state said death caus sarin nerv ga drop syrian aircraft russia said believ poison ga leak rebel chemic weapon depot struck syrian bomb sarin organophosporu compound nerv agent chlorin mustard ga also believ use past syria russian defenc ministri spokesman say agent use attack said rebel use chemic weapon aleppo last year said like kind chemic use attack suffer appar extern injuri die rapid onset similar symptom includ acut respiratori distress said expert turkey give guidanc overwhelm health worker idlib diagnosi treatment patient medicin atropin antidot type chemic exposur steroid symptomat treatment sent un commiss inquiri human right syria previous said forc loyal syrian presid bashar alassad use lethal chlorin ga multipl occas hundr civilian die sarin ga attack ghouta outskirt damascu august 2013 assad govern alway deni respons attack syria agre destroy chemic weapon 2013 deal broker moscow washington russia syrian alli china repeatedli veto unit nation move sanction assad refer situat syria intern crimin court type weapon ban intern law repres intoler barbar peter salama execut director health emerg programm said statement reuter
1914947532,Homs governor says U.S. attack caused deaths but doesnt see big human losses,"Fri 07 Apr 2017 at 0914 Homs governor says U.S. attack caused deaths but doesnt see big human losses. A U.S. missile strike on an airbase near the Syrian city of Homs on Friday caused deaths but is not believed to have resulted in ""big human casualties"" Homs Governor Talal Barazi said. Barazi said the attack served the interests of ""armed terrorist groups"" including Islamic State adding that the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra. Barazi was speaking in a series of phone interviews with media on Friday. He confirmed deaths at the airbase in a phone interview with Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen. ""I believe - God willing - that the human casualties are not big but there is material damage. We hope there are not many victims and martyrs"" he told Reuters by telephone. Speaking at dawn he said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base. He said the attack was a form of ""support for the armed terrorist groups and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorism"". Speaking to Syrian state TV Barazi said ""The Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. ""This targeting was not the first and I dont believe it will be the last"" he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen he said ""The war against terrorism will continue."" U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week declaring he acted in Americas ""national security interest"" against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. officials said the military fired dozens of cruise missiles against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assads forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. The U.S. strikes ""targeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specifically"" in order to publicly ""serve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long run"" Barazi added in his interview with state TV.-REUTERS",nna,4/7/2017,homs,0,fri 07 apr 2017 0914 hom governor say us attack caus death doesnt see big human loss us missil strike airbas near syrian citi hom friday caus death believ result big human casualti hom governor talal barazi said barazi said attack serv interest arm terrorist group includ islam state ad target airbas provid air support armi oper islam state east palmyra barazi speak seri phone interview media friday confirm death airbas phone interview lebanes tv station almayadeen believ god will human casualti big materi damag hope mani victim martyr told reuter telephon speak dawn said rescu firefight oper go two hour base said attack form support arm terrorist group attempt weaken capabl syrian arab armi combat terror speak syrian state tv barazi said syrian leadership syrian polici chang target first dont believ last ad separ comment almayadeen said war terror continu us presid donald trump said order missil strike airfield deadli chemic weapon attack launch week declar act america nation secur interest syrian presid bashar alassad us offici said militari fire dozen cruis missil base respons suspect ga attack rebelheld area washington blame assad forc syrian govern strongli deni respons us strike target militari posit syria hom specif order publicli serv goal terror syria goal israel long run barazi ad interview state tvreuter

The death toll from a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo reached at least 112 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers the Civil Defence said that they had carted away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place.

1914947537,22 dead in heavy U.S. raids on IS Syria stronghold,"Sun 05 Jul 2015 22 dead in heavy U.S. raids on IS Syria stronghold. Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State groups de facto Syrian capital on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were IS fighters the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded. The U.S.-led coalition which launched an air war against IS in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Raqa. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (IS) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading a coalition fighting IS in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control.

1914947538,Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown,"Sun 22 Feb 2015 Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown. A suicide bomber driving an ambulance killed four people on Sunday in an unprecedented attack on a hospital that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""A man drove an ambulance packed with explosives into the parking of the Qardaha hospital. Another man was in the vehicle with him but it was unclear whether he was an accomplice or a hostage. Four people were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 killed a nurse a hospital employee and two soldiers said Observatory director Abdel Rahman. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province - where the town is located - has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. - Troops kill 10 children - Meanwhile the Observatory said 10 children and 13 rebels were among 48 people executed by government forces in the northern village of Rityan earlier this week. The killings took place after troops entered the town Tuesday during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border. Abdel Rahman said all the dead were from six families. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family."" The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive this week to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged Shiite villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The heavy fighting claimed the lives of 129 loyalists and 116 rebels including an Al-Nusra commander according to an Observatory toll. - Air raids kill thousands - While the ground offensive failed warplanes kept pounding rebel areas of Aleppo city and other parts of the country. On Saturday two women and two children were among eight people killed when a barrel bomb hit a building in an opposition-held area of Aleppo city once Syrias commercial capital. Six people were also reported killed in rebel shelling of regime-held areas of the city. The air force also killed at least 10 people in rebel areas east of Damascus Saturday the Observatory said. According to the group they were the latest of more than 7000 people killed across Syria since the UN Security Council passed a resolution last year ordering an end to sieges and indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas. The Observatory ""has documented the killing of 5812 civilians including 1733 children 969 women and 3110 men in barrel bombings and (other) air raids"" over the past year. Meanwhile rebel fire on regime-held areas killed 1102 people said the Observatory adding that 234 of them were children. And 313 people died in areas under army siege in the past year as a result of food and medical shortages despite the fact that the resolution also ordered the lifting of sieges.-AFP",nna,2/22/2015,lattakia,0,sun 22 feb 2015 suicid bomber kill 4 assad clan hometown suicid bomber drive ambul kill four peopl sunday unpreced attack hospit took syria civil war rule assad clan hometown first time monitor group said attack came syrian observatori human right report troop execut 48 peopl earlier week northern villag among 10 children man drove ambul pack explos park qardaha hospit anoth man vehicl unclear whether accomplic hostag four peopl kill attack said observatori director rami abdel rahman earlier state televis report blast specifi natur attack attack first explos hit heart western town sinc outbreak syria civil war 2011 kill nurs hospit employe two soldier said observatori director abdel rahman outskirt qardaha previous come rocket fire latakia provinc town locat seen sever round heavi fight mausoleum contain grave presid bashar assad father predecessor hafez brother bassil locat qardaha clan rule syria iron fist 40 year syria war began march 2011 prodemocraci revolt seek assad ouster morph conflict regim unleash brutal crackdown dissent troop kill 10 children meanwhil observatori said 10 children 13 rebel among 48 peopl execut govern forc northern villag rityan earlier week kill took place troop enter town tuesday offens aim cut rebel suppli line turkish border abdel rahman said dead six famili resist except one hous rebel open fire troop execut along famili brief seizur rityan part abort armi offens week encircl rebelheld east aleppo reliev two besieg shiit villag north friday one villag taken govern forc recaptur rebel includ fighter alqaeda affili alnusra front heavi fight claim live 129 loyalist 116 rebel includ alnusra command accord observatori toll air raid kill thousand ground offens fail warplan kept pound rebel area aleppo citi part countri saturday two women two children among eight peopl kill barrel bomb hit build oppositionheld area aleppo citi syria commerci capit six peopl also report kill rebel shell regimeheld area citi air forc also kill least 10 peopl rebel area east damascu saturday observatori said accord group latest 7000 peopl kill across syria sinc un secur council pass resolut last year order end sieg indiscrimin use weapon popul area observatori document kill 5812 civilian includ 1733 children 969 women 3110 men barrel bomb air raid past year meanwhil rebel fire regimeheld area kill 1102 peopl said observatori ad 234 children 313 peopl die area armi sieg past year result food medic shortag despit fact resolut also order lift siegesafp

More than 120 people have been killed as troops allied to the Syrian regime stepped up attacks on Syrias Eastern Ghouta governorate focusing on the city of Douma around 10km northeast of Damascus. Regime aircraft have dropped more than 1000 bombs on the city in at least 150 airstrikes during the past ten days according to analysts. ""Rescue teams and volunteers continue to search for survivors and bodies under the rubble amid the mass destruction of neighbourhoods"" Osama Said a Douma-based media activist told al-Araby al-Jadeed. At least 400 people - mainly women and children - have been injured during this bombing campaign and 500 residential buildings have been destroyed according to the citys monitoring and documentation office. Retaliation The administration of President Bashar al-Assad said attacks had been ramped up after Zahran Alloush leader of the Army of Islam - a merged collection of rebel opposition groups - declared Damascus a military zone [Ar] and shot hundreds of missiles at the capital. 	 	Rescue teams and volunteers continue to search for survivors and bodies. - Osama Said media activist The latest escalation is also an attempt by regime forces to break into Eastern Ghouta which is controlled by the Army of Islam. Douma-based activists have drawn the worlds attention to their tragedy using the hashtag Doumaexterminated and its Arabic equivalent. Pictures and videos of the city posted using the hashtag have shown dozens of severely injured children receiving treatment at makeshift hospitals as well as injured civilians and dead bodies being pulled from the rubble. ""Pictures from Douma and the high civilian body count show the regime is targeting residential areas not military sites"" said Hisham Marwah the Syrian National Coalitions (SNC) vice-president. The regime has used this policy of collective punishment in many parts of Syria since the uprising began he added. Marwah called on the international community to put pressure on Assads regime to stop the massacres immediately. ""The international alliance should add Assads positions to the locations it is targeting in its attacks on the Islamic State group in Syria"" he added.

Hizballah fighters backed by Syrian and Iranian forces have pushed the Nusra Front and from the town of Deir al-Adas reports say in a major offensive in the Daraa governorate. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Deir al-Adas was taken on Tuesday after two days of fierce fighting between regime elements and rebels including members of Nusra al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria and fighters from the Free Syrian Army. The offensive is part of the operation launched on Sunday to seize areas at the intersection point of the three Syrian governorates of Rif Dimashq Daraa and Quneitra near the disputed Golan Heights. The observatory group said 20 opposition fighters were killed in the fighting including a Hizballah ambush near Deir al-Adas. The groups director Rami Abdulrahman told the AFP news agency that Hizballah was leading the attack on Deir al-Adas and its surrounding hills. Al-Araby al-Jadeed cannot independently verify the reports.

The opposition Local Coordination Committee of Deir al-Adas said heavy shelling had forced the Free Syrian Army from the town which was now ""in range of their firepower"".

1915433675,Syrian opposition remains divided,"23 February 2015 The Sawaiq al-Rahman Brigade has announced it has killed several Nusra Front fighters as clashes between opposition groups continue. Tags Syria Free Syrian Army opposition groups Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade al-Nusra Front Idlib The Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade announced on Monday that it had killed six Nusra Front fighters and injured several others in the countryside south of Idlib in northwest Syria. The brigade is a Syrian opposition faction affiliated with the Free Syrian Army (FSA). ""The operation was carried out in response to al-Nusras attack on the town of Amiriyah when it set fire to several houses - including one belonging to Mithqal al-Abdallah a former Syrian Revolutionary Front (SRF) commander"" the Sawaiq al-Rahman brigade stated. 	 	Al-Nusra has many enemies. It also has many hostages including my son. - Col Haitham Afisi former FSA deputy chief of staff The brigade also recently killed Abu Hassan an al-Nusra leader in the town of Salqin in the countryside around Idlib. He was hanged for ""violations committed by al-Nusra against the towns civilians"" according to a statement issued by the brigade. The FSAs special forces seventh division also issued a statement giving al-Nusra 48 hours to release those it took hostage nearly a week ago when it stormed its headquarters in the town of Ain Larouz. Those taken include the divisions commander and several fighters. The statement also called on al-Nusra to return all possessions it had taken and to abide by ""the law of God"" to prevent further bloodshed. Former FSA Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Haitham Afisi said that over the past eight months al-Nusra had also attacked fighters from groups including the FSA SRF Hazzm Maarat al-Noman martyrs brigade Idlib martyrs brigade and those led by Mithal al-Abdallah and Yusuf al-Hassan. ""Al-Nusra has many enemies. It also has many hostages including my son a brigade commander that has been detained for over four months"" Afisi told al-Araby al-Jadeed. The colonel said the group had lost popular support and become a target itself while that those it had attacked were likely to unite against it. The Nusra Front is an al-Qaeda franchise operating in Syria and Lebanon that aims to overthrow the regime of President Assad in Syria. The group has been designated ""a terrorist organisation"" by many western governments.

Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria.

Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler.

1915433685,Ahrar al-Sham leader killed in Syria,"15 July 2015 Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen leader of Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing that targeted the group for the second time in less than a year. Tags Syria Ahrar al-Sham Nusra Front suicide bombing Staffan De Mistura Southern Front alliance regime forces Hezbollah Zabadani Islamic State group airstrikes A double suicide bombing in northern Syria on Tuesday targeted the headquarters of an Islamist rebel group killing its leader and several other high ranking members. The attack was the second time in less than a year that a bombing takes out the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham (""Free men of the Levant"") one of the most powerful Islamic groups fighting both President Bashar Assads forces and its rival the Islamic State group which holds wide swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Tuesdays attack struck the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham northwest of the town of Idlib killing the groups leader Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six other Ahrar al-Sham members also died. The Local Coordination Committees and other activists also reported the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. 	 	 The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. 	 	Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago.

Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway.

Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP the ""intensified air attacks by regime forces on al-Bab are aimed at foiling IS efforts on multiple fronts"" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which IS has besieged for more than a year. Al-Bab is strategically important because it is one of ISs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he said. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town.

1915433694,Syria army plane crashes in rebel-held town,3 August 2015 A Syrian military aircraft crashed while on a bombing run over the rebel-held northwestern town of Ariha on Monday leaving at least 27 people dead a monitoring group said. Tags Syria Idlib Ariha Assad war Government air raids in a northwestern town in Syria and a subsequent crash by a Syrian warplane that slammed into a residential area there killed at least 27 people on Monday activists said. The raids on the town of Ariha came amid intense clashes between government forces and insurgents in the northwestern province of Idlib and the central region of Hama. The town once a government stronghold was captured by opposition fighters and Islamic militants in May. Government forces have suffered setbacks in Idlib province since March including the loss of the provincial capital of the same name. An activist group known as the Local Coordination Committees said the warplane crashed in a busy market adding that it was not immediately clear whether it was shot down. The LCC said 27 people were killed and many others were wounded. Rami Abdurrahman who heads another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the plane crashed in the town centre destroying several homes. The Observatory later said that 31 people were killed and more than 60 were wounded. The Ariha Today Facebook page posted a photo showing at least seven buildings reduced to rubble on a narrow street. It said 27 people were killed but that 12 of them have not been identified yet. The group also listed 55 wounded including nine women. The discrepancies in the different casualty figures reported could not be reconciled. The Observatory and the LCC said that at the time of the crash the town was under attack by Syrian President Bashar Assads air force. An amateur video posted online by activists showed several damaged buildings as well as parts of the plane that crashed. Syrias civil war began in March 2011. The United Nations says the war has killed more than 220000 people wounded at least one million and left many displaced internally and in neighbouring countries.

1918150026,Chemical Massacre in Idlib Defies the World,"April 5 2017 by Youssef Diab Paula Astih and Najla Habriri ""Chemical"" Massacre in Idlib Defies the World Beirut London- Warplanes releasing toxic gas targeted Tuesday the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib northwestern Syria massacring dozens of people and injuring hundreds. Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack only targeted civilians in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted. While UN war crimes investigators are looking into the alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town in Idlib the Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it is seriously concerned about the attack. It said its Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is in the process of gathering and analyzing information from all available sources. Several countries also condemned the attack. The White House considered it as unacceptable while US President Donald Trump said These heinous actions by the Bashar Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution.For his part French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian regime forces for the attack while High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the regime of Assad bears primary responsibility.Commenting on what happened in Khan Sheikhoun UN special envoy for Syria Staffa de Mistura said This was horrific im sure there will be a Security Council meeting on this for clear identification of responsibilities accountability.

1918150027,Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria,April 18 2017 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria. For two Syrian mothers on opposite sides of a two-year siege their evacuation from the blockade was supposed to end their suffering but that was not the case in wake of a bombing outside the city of Aleppo. Noha a Shiite and Samira a Sunni were besieged for nearly two years on each side of Syrias civil war. At the weekend they finally escaped the suffocating blockades under an evacuation agreement but their ordeal was not over. As they waited at two transit points miles apart outside Aleppo a bomb attack hit Nohas bus convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of children. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory. In the hours leading up to Saturdays attacks the two women spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. Reuters was not allowed back past security to try to find Noha after the blast and lost contact with Samira after speaking to her earlier on another evacuees phone. Weve lost everything. We hope to go back one day but I dont expect we wil said Noha 45 asking not to be identified by her last name. Noha left al-Foua one of two Shiite villages besieged by Syrian insurgents in Idlib province with her two youngest children and 5000 other people under a deal between the Syrian regime and armed opposition. In exchange 2000 Sunni residents and rebel fighters from the regime-besieged town of Madaya near Damascus Samiras hometown were given safe passage out and bussed to Idlib province a rebel stronghold via Aleppo. Thousands of Syrians have been evacuated from besieged areas in recent months under deals between Bashar al-Assads regime and rebels fighting for six years to unseat him. Rebels say it amounts to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country and engenders demographic change because most of the opposition and Syrias population are Sunni. There was little choice. We had to leave we were scared said Samira 55 who was traveling with her five adult sons. She had feared her sons would be arrested or forced to join the Syrian regime forces and fight once troops and officials of the Damascus regime moved into the town. Like Noha Samira was relieved to have escaped a crushing siege which had caused widespread hunger and in the case of Madaya starvation but had left everything behind including family. We owned three houses farmland and three shops in Madaya town. Now we dont have a single Syrian pound she said. Her daughter pregnant with a third child had stayed in Madaya because her husband had vowed to live and die there she said. Samira has not heard from her own husband for nearly four years after he was arrested by the regime. With nothing left and no place to stay in Idlib other than camps Samira said she would try to migrate joining the 5 million Syrian refugees who have left since the war broke out in 2011. More than 6 million are internally displaced. I dont want to be in Idlib we know no one there. Also you dont know when or where the jets might bomb she said referring to the heavy bombardment by Russian and Syrian warplanes of rebel-held areas in Idlib including a recent alleged poison gas attack. The plan is to try to get to Turkey to leave Syria for good. Noha was also heading into the unknown. I dont know where well live whether they (authorities) have anything set up. At the very least we just want to be safe. The children jump at night from the sound of rockets. We just want security wherever they take us she said. Her adult son and daughter had stayed in al-Foua but were hoping to leave in the next stage of the evacuation deal. Nohas husband had been killed but she did not say how. Both women said they would never have left their hometowns but for the strangling sieges which caused severe food and medicine shortages and the gradual change of control in each area. On Saturday a deadly explosion killed at least 100 including children regime supporters and opposition fighters at an evacuation point adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation. The blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of regime loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot guarded by regime troops.

1918150028,Six Killed in Aleppo Bombing as Evacuation of 4 Syrian Towns Resumes ,Posted on April 19 2017 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Six Killed in Aleppo Bombing as Evacuation of 4 Syrian Towns Resumes Six people were killed and dozens others wounded in a blast that rocked the northern Syrian city of Aleppo at a time when a complex evacuation deal was being carried out a few kilometers away in Rashidin a southwestern suburb of the city. Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

1918150030,58 Killed in Suspected Gas Attack in Syrias Idlib,Posted on April 4 2017 by Asharq Al-Awsat English 58 Killed in Suspected Gas Attack in Syrias Idlib Dozens of people have been killed in Syrias northern Idlib province on Tuesday in a suspected chemical attack that has been described as among the worst in the countrys six-year war. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group put the death toll at 58 saying there were 11 children among the dead. Meanwhile the Idlib Media Center said dozens of people had been killed. There was no comment from the regime in Damascus or any international agency in the immediate aftermath of the attack. A Syrian regime source denied that the regime had used any such weapons saying the army does not and has not used chemical weapons not in the past and not in the future. It deemed such claims as rebel propaganda. It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun the site of Tuesdays alleged attack. The Syrian American Medical Society which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory said it had sent a team of inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun before noon and an investigation was underway. The Syrian activists had no information on what agent could have been used in the assault. They claimed the attack was caused by an airstrike carried out either by the regime or Russian warplanes. A Turkey-based Syrian woman whose niece husband and one-year-old daughter were among those killed said the warplanes struck early as residents were still in their beds she said speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared for the safety of family members back in Syria. Makeshift hospitals soon crowded with people suffocating. The province of Idlib is almost entirely controlled by the Syrian opposition. It is home to some 900000 displaced Syrians according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the regime is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province. Tuesdays reports came on the eve of a major international meeting in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region hosted by the EUs High Representative Federica Mogherini. Claims of chemical weapons attacks particularly the use of the chlorine agent are not uncommon in Syrias conflict. The worst attack was what a UN report said was an attack by toxic sarin gas in August 2013 on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians. The Syrian Coalition an opposition group based outside the country said regime planes carried out the airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun south of the city of Idlib the provincial capital. It said the planes fired missiles carrying poisonous gases killing dozens of people many of them women and children. The coalition described the attack as a horrifying massacre. Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun show limp bodies of children and adults. Some are seen struggling to breathe; others appear foaming at the mouth. A medical doctor going by the name of Dr. Shajul Islam for fears for his own safety said his hospital in Idlib province received three victims all with narrow pinpoint pupils that did not respond to light. He published video of the patients on his Twitter account. Pinpoint pupils breathing difficulties and foaming at the mouth are symptoms commonly associated with toxic gas exposure. The oppositions Civil Defense search-and-rescue group which released photos showing paramedics washing down victims has not published a casualty toll. The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims from the scene by a pickup truck. The victims were stripped down to their underwear. Many appeared unresponsive. Warplanes continued to pound the town after the attack including near a medical point where victims were being treated the Observatory said. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian regime of conducting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months in the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. Also a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the regime was behind at least three attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas and the ISIS group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.

MSF reported that the regime targeted Latamneh hospital in the northern Hama governorate killing two people and causing severe respiratory symptoms among patients and staff. The hospitals orthopedic surgeon Dr. Darwish was one of two people killed. Thirteen people were transferred to other facilities for treatment. It reported that at around 600 pm on March 25 the Latamneh hospital was targeted by a bomb dropped by a helicopter which hit the entrance of the building. The organization relied in its report on information from the hospital staff that proved that chemical weapons were used. Patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranessymptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals. The hospital went out of service for three days due to the attack after which the emergency room reopened. The hospital is located a few miles from the frontlines and provides medical care for around 8000 people. Prior to the attacks the hospital had an emergency room and inpatient department and provided general and orthopedic surgery. Massimiliano Rebaudengo MSFs head of mission in northern Syria said that the loss of Dr. Darwish leaves just two orthopedic surgeons for a population of around 120000. Bombing hospitals although banned by International Humanitarian Law remains a common practice in Syria and health services are severely affected by these repeated attacks he added. Over the past year MSF has received reports of at least 71 attacks on 32 different health facilities which it runs or supports in Syria. On February 22 an MSF-supported health facility in Idlib governorate was hit by rockets killing six and wounding 33 others. Meanwhile Al-Nasr Army announced that the Hama battle will continue and the retreat of rebels from several locations does not mean they have been defeated. Battles continued between the regime forces and opposition factions on all fronts in Hama coinciding with dozens of air raids by Russian and Syrian war planes. Al-Nasr Army military spokesperson Lieutenant Iyad al-Homsi said The criminal gangs resorted to chemical weapons when they were no longer able to defeat us in the battlefield. Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat he added Those who witness the number of deaths of regime forces and its affiliated militias will realize that victory is ours. We have proven to the world that after six years of killing destruction and displacement that our revolution will continue. Head of the Hama Media center Abu Yazan al-Noiami said that the retreat of rebel forces and the consequent advances of the regime over the past two days were caused by the regimes use of chemical gases. He added that both the regime and Iranian forces are resorting to media blackouts to hide the very high figures of their losses. He stressed Hundreds of Iranian militants were killed and over 30 tanks personnel vehicles and cannons were destroyed in this battle. In a new development 17 armed factions in coastal regions Aleppo Hama and Idlib announced that they agreed to form a comprehensive military operations room aimed at fighting the Syrian regime and restoring stability in the region. Opposition website al-Durrar al-Shamiyyah reported an informed source as saying that factions of al-Jabha al-Shamiyyah al-Sham Legion Mujahideen Army al-Nasr Army Idlib Army Freedom Brigade the Middle Company and many others are part of this operations room. According to the source Colonel Fadlullah Naji of the al-Sham Legion will head the room adding that during the last month and a half the troops had been meeting to agree on all details which he did not disclose. He said that the final meeting will be held in the coming few days to present the framework of the room after which it will be officially announced.

1918150033,Toxic Gas Dropped on Syrian Town After Russian Helicopter is Shot Down,Posted on August 3 2016 by Jordan Dakamseh Toxic Gas Dropped on Syrian Town After Russian Helicopter is Shot Down The President of the UN Security Council for August the permanent representative of Malaysia to the UN Ramlan Ibrahim said that the Council will discuss who is responsible for the use of chemical weapons in Syria during this month and will announce the results at the end of it. Meanwhile a spokesman for Syria Civil Defence said that 33 people mostly women and the children were affected by the gas which they suspect was chlorine in Saraqeb Idlib province. Medium-sized barrels containing toxic gases fell close to where a Russian military helicopter had been shot down hours earlier. The Syria Civil Defence which describes itself as a neutral group of volunteers that carry out searches and rescue work in areas controlled by the armed opposition posted a video on YouTube that showed a number of men trying to breathe and members dressed in the Syria Civil Defence uniforms giving them oxygen masks. Syria Civil Defence workers who went to the site said that they suspected that the gas used was chlorine gas but that it is difficult to confirm this. The organisations spokesman said that Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gases. The Syrian Civil Defence was not able to determine the type of the gas. Monitors at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence on all sides in the civil war said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday wounding a large number of citizens. Reuters quoted the US State Department as saying that it was looking into the reported use of chemical weapons in Saraqeb. Its spokesman John Kirby said that he is not in a position to confirm the veracity of (the reports) and continued by saying Certainly if its true it would be extremely serious. Russias Ministry of Defence said that a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb on Monday killing all five people on board in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life experienced by Russian forces since they started operations in Syria. Government and opposition forces have both denied using chemical weapons during the civil war that has been going on for the last five years. Western powers say that the government has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. Assads regime and Russia have accused rebels of using toxic gas.

1918150036,Dozens Killed in International Coalition Airstrikes on Manbij,Posted on July 20 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat Dozens Killed in International Coalition Airstrikes on Manbij A day after the first massacre that took place in the Al-Hazawiya neighbourhood in Manbij the Aleppo countryside airstrikes led by the international coalition have killed dozens of people and injured others in Tokhar according to the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week. The Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bombing carried out by the international coalition targeted the outskirts of the village of Tokhar at dawn yesterday which resulted in 56 civilians dying including 11 children. Other Syrian opposition websites stated that the death toll has risen to 85 people including five entire families most of which were women and children after residential areas were targeted. Opposition websites also stated that the bombing resulted in the destruction of a mill and a number of mosques and schools.

1918150039,Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town,Posted on July 2 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Thirty Killed in Syrian Strikes on Damascan Suburb Town Thirty civilians were killed on Saturday in intensive Syrian air strikes on a Damascan suburb town northeast of the city a day after the reported execution of a Syrian air force pilot a monitor and rebels said. The raids targeted a medical center a school and a residential area in Jayrud town rebels said. Jayrud is a heavily populated area that struck a local truce with the army that had saved it from the heavy bombing on other rebel held areas. It had made it a sanctuary for thousands of civilians fleeing heavy battles nearby. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said scores were also injured in the aerial strikes as well as shelling from army posts in the area. A rebel spokesman said the strikes seemed to be in retaliation for the killing of a Syrian air force pilot who parachuted down near the town after his plane crashed on Friday. The strikes against civilians are in retaliation against the execution of the pilot by Nusra Front said Said Seif al Qalamoni from the Free Syrian Armys (FSA) Shahid Ahmad Abdo brigade that operates in Jayrud alongside the al Qaedas Nusra Front and other groups. Rebels in a joint operations room targeted a main army base in the region with Russian-made surface to surface missiles after the aerial strikes al Qalamoni said. Syrian state media said the crash was due to a technical fault and the pilot had ejected while the rebel group Jaish al-Islam said it had shot down the plane but did not say how. Jaish al Islam said the pilot was arrested and was subsequently killed by a fighter from the Nusra Front while being held at a joint command center. The army had warned of a strong response after the execution of the pilot was reported shortly after he was shown on a rebel video circulated on social media giving details of his mission. Separately Russian and Syrian planes intensified their bombing on Saturday of a strategic rebel-held area of Aleppo that is near the only route into opposition-held parts of the northern city. If the Malah area were to fall to the army and its allies they would succeed in laying siege to areas where over 400000 people live under rebel control.

1918150046,Syria Kurdish Islamist violence kills 12 Al-Qaeda-linked fighters,Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution.

1918398776,Syrian army advances near Aleppo,"Published February 18 2015 The Syrian army backed by allied militia has captured several villages north of Aleppo from insurgents and fighting has blocked a main supply route leading into the northern city a monitoring group said on Tuesday. A U.N. mediator has been struggling to broker a ceasefire in Aleppo and government forces had long been expected to try to encircle it completely aiming to drive insurgents from Syrias second city and take control of their main supply road. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said pro-government forces had blocked a road leading towards the Turkish border as heavy clashes continued there. The army also took villages including Bashkuwi and Sifat while battles raged in Hardatain and Ratain said the Observatory which tracks the Syrian conflict using sources on the ground. It added that at least 16 insurgents were killed. Aleppo is at the heart of clashes between pro-government forces and a range of insurgents which include extremist brigades al Qaedas hardline Syria wing Nusra Front foreign fighters in other groups and Western-backed rebels. ""It is very important because if they continue like this they will completely cut the supply lines for the future. The Syrian regime is moving forward there"" the Observatorys founder Rami Abdulrahman said. More than 210000 people have died in the Syrian conflict which will enter its fifth year next month the Observatory has estimated with fighting between numerous factions regularly flaring across the country. Villages and towns outside Aleppo have passed between pro-government and insurgent fighters before. Insurgent-held districts in the divided city have come under heavy air force bombardment while Syrian state television said on Tuesday that five people had been killed and 18 wounded in ""terrorist"" rocket attacks in Aleppo neighborhoods. A television channel run by Lebanese group Hezbollah which is fighting alongside pro-government units reported that the Syrian army had taken control of areas north of Aleppo. The Observatory said Hezbollah was involved in the battle. The pro-government al-Watan newspaper said on Monday that government forces aimed to completely surround the city this week in a major offensive against insurgent groups. In December mainly extremist insurgent factions in Aleppo grouped together to form Jabhat al-Shamiyya the Levant Front an attempt at unity among their fighters.

1918398778,Monitor 10 of 48 people executed by forces loyal to regime were children,"Published February 23 2015 Ten children were among at least 48 people killed in a Syrian village last week when regime forces executed six families of rebel fighters a monitoring group said on Saturday Tuesdays executions took place in the village of Rityan north of second city Aleppo after regime forces entered that day during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said that villagers had discovered the bodies when they returned to their homes after the regime forces withdrew a day later. Five women and 13 rebels from the six families were among the dead. ""The troops and militiamen knew exactly where they lived thanks to the informers who accompanied them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family"" he added. Activist Mamun Abu Omar said some of the bodies had been mutilated. Syrian regime forces killed 48 alleged rebels in Hardatnin village in Aleppo in northern Syria according to a statement released Saturday by the Syrian Revolution General Commission. Regime forces killed 48 civilians by shooting or slaughtering the victims before withdrawing from the village Friday night. The victims included women and children. The massacre was discovered when the rebels completely seized control of Hardatnin village on Saturday according to the statement. The opposition forces freed 150 civilians who were captured at a school in the village. A field hospital documented a list of the 48 victims names. Mustafa Sultan a local activist in the area confirmed the death toll saying that regime forces backed by Hezbollah factions killed the civilians before their withdrawal. A report released by a group of U.N. experts investigating war crimes on Friday said that ""unthinkable"" crimes continue to occur on a daily basis in Syria as the conflict approaches its fifth year. The U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria called for urgent attention to be paid to the shocking crimes committed by the Syrian regime Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant militants and other armed opposition groups. The report said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regimes ""surrender or starve"" siege strategy has left thousands of people particularly infants dead over the past four years citing the victims describing the regimes strategy as that of ""draining the sea to kill the fish."" The regime has been using barrel bombs since 2012 targeting crowded areas such as bakery lines transportation hubs apartment buildings markets and aid distributions which led to an increase in the number of persons with disabilities according to the report. The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive launched this week to try to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages initially taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters of Al-Qaida affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

1918398779,Suicide bomber kills 4 in Assad clans hometown,"Published February 23 2015 A suicide bomber killed four people in a hospital on Sunday in an attack that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person"" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. ""Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province where the town is located has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha.

1918398782,US-led airstrikes target ISIS stronghold Raqqa,"Published July 5 2015 U.S.-led coalition aircraft unleashed a series of airstrikes targeting the self proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) groups stronghold of Raqqa in eastern Syria in what the coalition said Sunday was one of its most sustained aerial operations carried out in Syria to date. ISIS said at least 10 people were killed and many others wounded. At least 16 airstrikes were reported late Saturday and early Sunday triggering successive explosions that shook the city and created panic among residents activists said. The U.S.-led coalition often targets ISIS-held towns and cities in Syria but the overnight strikes on Raqqa were rare in their intensity. In a statement issued early Sunday the coalition said it had conducted 16 airstrikes throughout Raqqa destroying vital ISIS-controlled structures and transit routes in Syria. ""The significant airstrikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" said coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Gilleran using the Arabic acronym for the ISIS group. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move"" from Raqqa he said. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the so-called caliphate declared a year ago by the ISIS terror group in territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. The sustained airstrikes add pressure on the militants in Raqqa still reeling from last months loss of the border town of Tal Abyad to Kurdish fighters. The town on the Turkish border was a major avenue for commerce and smuggling for the group. A militant website said 10 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. An ISIS-affiliated Facebook page said one civilian was among those killed and 10 were wounded including women and children. It also said the bombing destroyed several bridges. The ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video of what it said was the effects of shelling Saturday by a U.S. drone on Raqqa. It showed several wounded men on a stretcher and at least three young boys being treated for wounds at what appeared to be a hospital. A Raqqa-based anti-ISIS activist network reported eight civilians were killed by the coalition airstrikes including a 10-year-old child. The casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. The network called Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered said at least one airstrike targeted a group of ISIS members in the city center. Another targeted an ISIS checkpoint while a third destroyed large parts of an ISIS-held brick factory in the city. In the remote northeastern city of Hassakeh ISIS suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden truck near a main power plant Sunday. State-run news agency SANA reported casualties and damage in the plant on the southern edge of the city. Fighting has raged in Hassakeh since the ISIS group attacked several southern neighborhoods held by government troops earlier this month. The violence has forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The predominantly Kurdish city was split between government forces and Kurdish fighters who have been fighting the ISIS group separately. In Iraq a Defense Ministry statement said government forces repelled an ISIS attack Sunday morning on the town of Haditha and the nearby Haditha dam in Anbar province. At least 20 militants were killed in the failed attack said the statement which did not provide any further information. Iraqi forces backed by Shiite militias have been struggling to recapture areas lost to the ISIS group in the countrys west and north. In May the militant group scored a stunning victory overrunning Ramadi the provincial capital of western Anbar province. Yet Haditha and some other towns remain under control of government forces and allied Sunni tribal fighters. In Lebanon some 200 Kurdish nationals staged a demonstration in downtown Beirut in solidarity with their brethren in Syria who are fighting against ISIS militants.",dailysabah,7/5/2015,raqqa,1,publish juli 5 2015 usl coalit aircraft unleash seri airstrik target self proclaim islam state isi group stronghold raqqa eastern syria coalit said sunday one sustain aerial oper carri syria date isi said least 10 peopl kill mani other wound least 16 airstrik report late saturday earli sunday trigger success explos shook citi creat panic among resid activist said usl coalit often target isisheld town citi syria overnight strike raqqa rare intens statement issu earli sunday coalit said conduct 16 airstrik throughout raqqa destroy vital isiscontrol structur transit rout syria signific airstrik tonight execut deni daesh abil move militari capabl throughout syria iraq said coalit spokesman lt col thoma gilleran use arab acronym isi group one largest deliber engag conduct date syria debilit effect daesh abil move raqqa said raqqa de facto capit socal caliph declar year ago isi terror group territori control iraq syria sustain airstrik add pressur milit raqqa still reel last month loss border town tal abyad kurdish fighter town turkish border major avenu commerc smuggl group milit websit said 10 peopl kill dozen other wound isisaffili facebook page said one civilian among kill 10 wound includ women children also said bomb destroy sever bridg isisaffili aamaq news agenc releas video said effect shell saturday us drone raqqa show sever wound men stretcher least three young boy treat wound appear hospit raqqabas antiisi activist network report eight civilian kill coalit airstrik includ 10yearold child casualti figur could independ confirm network call raqqa silent slaughter said least one airstrik target group isi member citi center anoth target isi checkpoint third destroy larg part isisheld brick factori citi remot northeastern citi hassakeh isi suicid bomber deton explosivesladen truck near main power plant sunday staterun news agenc sana report casualti damag plant southern edg citi fight rage hassakeh sinc isi group attack sever southern neighborhood held govern troop earlier month violenc forc ten thousand resid flee predominantli kurdish citi split govern forc kurdish fighter fight isi group separ iraq defens ministri statement said govern forc repel isi attack sunday morn town haditha nearbi haditha dam anbar provinc least 20 milit kill fail attack said statement provid inform iraqi forc back shiit militia struggl recaptur area lost isi group countri west north may milit group score stun victori overrun ramadi provinci capit western anbar provinc yet haditha town remain control govern forc alli sunni tribal fighter lebanon 200 kurdish nation stage demonstr downtown beirut solidar brethren syria fight isi milit
1918398784,Assad regime launches operation in Latakia region attacks Syrian Turkmen village,"Published July 20 2015 A checkpoint that belonged to Assads forces is seen after a coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh said they took control of it on a highway that connects Aleppo to Latakia June 6 2015 (Reuters) Two people were killed and 15 injured as Syrian regime forces attacked the Avanl village of the Jabal al-Turkmen Mountain predominantly inhabited by Syrian Turkmens located in the northwestern Latakia province. According to Syria Turks Association tanks artillery and missiles were used in the attack and explosions were also heard in villages located on the Turkish side of the border. Four wounded were brought to hospitals in Turkeys Hatay province for treatment. The attack is a larger part of the operation as Syrian army announced on Sunday that it had stepped up air strikes and retaken villages in a new offensive on opposition forces in coastal province of Latakia. Aerial bombardment had intensified over the past 48 hours in a bid to cut rebel supply lines in rugged territory close to Turkeys border an army source was quoted as saying on state media. Latakia province - home to Syrias biggest port and a stronghold of President Bashar al Assads Alawite sect - has been a key battleground of the conflict which is now in its fifth year. Sunni Muslim groups including al Qaedas Syrian offshoot the Nusra Front control many villages in the borderlands north of the government-held Mediterranean port city of Latakia and other areas dominated by Alawites who follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The army said five villages and hilltops including Beit Khadour Beit Zaifa Tel alKhadar and Jabal al Rahmaliya had been wrested back from the insurgents bringing it closer to the border areas. The army had stepped up its campaign in the province since insurgents took the strategically located town of Jisr al Shughour in April strengthening their position in a mountain range that overlooks Alawite villages and close to Qardaha hometown of the Assad family. The area has been in control of opposition forces since September 2012. The rough terrain and heavy forests has allowed the opposition forces to resist heavy Syrian army shelling and withstand heavy aerial bombing defense analysts say. A Syrian army officer said the aim of the latest operation was to cut rebel supply lines from the Turkish border to the rebel held villages including the town of Salma that has been held by Nusra Front since 2012. ""These armed men are weaker than to try to dare get close to Latakia"" a senior army officer was quoted as saying in a report from the area by Lebanese Hezbollahs television al-Manars correspondent. Last year the Syrian army wrested back control of the Christian town border town of Kasab a gateway to Turkey nearer the coast in Latakia after less than three months of control by opposition forces including Nusra Front.

(AFP Photo) At least 18 civilians were killed on Tuesday when a ground-to-ground missile struck a rebel-held neighborhood in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo a monitoring group said. Another 50 were wounded or missing in the citys central neighborhood of Maghawir the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said blaming the attack on forces loyal to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Aleppo Syrias largest city before it was engulfed by fighting in 2012 is divided between the Assad regime-held western districts and the rebel-held east. In the Qalamoun region west of the capital Damascus government forces backed by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah seized areas outside Zabadani the last rebel-controlled town in the area. The Hezbollah said it had taken control of the plain outside the city and a main road in cooperation with the Syrian army. ""The city of Zabadani is under the full siege of the Syrian army and our resistance fighters"" the terrorist group said. Hezbollah is trying to eliminate rebel forces from all areas between the Lebanese border and Damascus. Zabadani lies 12 kilometers from the border crossing on the Damascus-Beirut highway and about 25 kilometers north-west of the Syrian capital. The Syrian conflict which started when the Assad regime forces brutally repressed peaceful protests in 2011 has descended into a multi-sided civil war. Forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad are facing off against an array of rebel and terrorist groups and both sides are under attack from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) group which now controls most of eastern Syrian territory.

1918398795,2 medics among at least 31 dead in regime shelling of opposition-held Syrian town,"Published July 2 2016 Two medics were among at least 31 people killed on Saturday in Syrian government shelling of an opposition-held town northeast of the capital the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The bombardment struck the town of Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) from Damascus where the army says opposition forces killed a pilot they captured after he was forced to eject on Friday. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said it was the first bombardment of the town in at least two years. ""Prominent figures in Jayrud have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. He said at least 31 people were killed including two medics. It was not immediately clear how many of the rest were civilians. Activists in the town said the head of the local medical centre and several colleagues were killed. ""There have been at least 45 air strikes today. The towns medical centre was hit and its director Amjad al-Danaf was killed"" activist Abu Malek al-Jayrudi told AFP via the Internet. He said the town is home to some 60000 people and that the bombardment had not stopped since early Saturday. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force.

1918398799,Coalition airstrikes kill 85 civilians in Daesh-held villages in Syrias Manbij,Published July 19 2016 A Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter walks in the silos and mills of Manbij after the SDF took control of it in Aleppo Governorate Syria July 1 2016. (Reuters Photo) Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.,dailysabah,7/19/2016,aleppo,1,publish juli 19 2016 syria democrat forc sdf fighter walk silo mill manbij sdf took control aleppo governor syria juli 1 2016 reuter photo airstrik daeshheld villag northern syria kill least 85 civilian tuesday intens fight underway milit usback fighter syrian opposit activist extremist group said resid area blame usl coalit strike target two villag tokhar hoshariyeh control activist said villag near daesh stronghold manbij town member pyddomin usback syria democrat forc sdf tri captur weekslong offens britainbas syrian observatori human right said least 56 civilian includ 11 children kill strike villag also wound dozen anoth activist group local coordin committe said dozen civilian mostli famili kill turkey offici anadolu agenc put death toll least 85 ad 50 civilian also wound airstrik daeshlink aamaq news agenc claim 160 civilian mostli women children kill tokhar alon seri purportedli american airstrik around dawn tuesday post facebook page show imag peopl includ children put collect grave purportedli villag tokhar one photograph show man carri lifeless bodi child cover dust anoth show child partli cover blanket lie grave tuesday casualti come heel similar airstrik daeshheld town manbij monday least 15 civilian reportedli kill meanwhil headquart daesh milit insid manbij captur sdf forc push western part town weekend us militari said statement tuesday headquart locat hospit use command center logist hub usback syrian rebel also took control part town enabl civilian area flee fight statement said rebel continu battl daesh four front control manbij clear territori push toward center citi statement said daesh milit stage counterattack syrian rebel maintain momentum help air strike usl coalit statement said said coalit carri 450 air strike around manbij sinc oper take town began us central command said coalit conduct 18 strike monday destroy 13 daesh fight posit seven daesh vehicl two car bomb near manbij manbij area seen intens battl daesh extremist kurdishl fighter advanc cover intens airstrik usl coalit manbij captur usback fighter biggest strateg defeat daesh syria sinc juli 2015 extremist group lost border town tal abyad neighbor iraq meanwhil daesh beaten back sever front iraqi forc aid usl coalit airstrik retaken citi ramadi fallujah western anbar provinc
1918398801,Assad regime surrounds Aleppo opposition groups resist despite intense raids,"Published July 12 2016 A man carries an injured girl after an airstrike on Aleppos opposition held Kadi Askar in Aleppo. Bashar Assads forces with assistance from Russian airstrikes is continuing its siege of opposition groups in Aleppo and is attempting to cut a road leading into the opposition-held section of the city while the groups continue to wage fierce battles despite intensified airstrikes some of which have reportedly targeted civilians. The groups had previously launched an attack against regime positions in the historic center of Aleppo on Monday in response to an offensive on Castello Road which is used for supplies and access severing opposition-held areas under siege where at least 250000 people live. Regime airstrikes killed 20 civilians on Monday in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood of Aleppo Syria Live Network (SLN) reported. One civilian was killed and many others were injured by a regime barrel bomb dropped on al-Jalloum. Many civilians were wounded in the attacks on the al-Ansari neighborhood. Inflicting heavy casualties in the battlefield the regime also intensified its aerial artillery and missile bombardment on the neighborhoods of Bab Qensrin al-Kallaseh Bab al-Hadid and Bab al-Nasr in Aleppos old city. Eyewitnesses said that the regime used cluster bombs and vacuum bombs in the airstrikes. Elsewhere jets believed to be Russian or Syrian also struck a fuel market in a town in the northwestern province of Idlib killing 18 people and injuring scores more according to a local rescue worker near the site. An airstrike hit a local field hospital in the town of Ahsem in Idlib province killing three people including a child an international charity and an aid worker said. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods of Aleppo. The assault was ""a response to the [government] attempts to advance"" Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. He said insurgents had already made gains and that much of the fighting was taking place in Aleppos ancient old city a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site now largely in ruins. A witness reported fierce close-range clashes near the historic citadel where the opposition killed at least 20 army troops when they blew up a tunnel they dug underneath a regime post. The city Syrias largest before the war has been a main battleground in the countrys five-year war and has seen an escalation of fighting after peace talks and a fragile ceasefire broke down earlier this year. Its capture would be a strategic prize for the Assad regime which controls the major population centers in western Syria apart from opposition-held areas of Aleppo and the city of Idlib. Opposition also control pockets of territory elsewhere in western Syria. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killing five people and wounding dozens more observers said. A U.N. spokeswoman said that intensified fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in contested Aleppo has completely cut off the only road allowing access for humanitarian aid deliveries into the rebel-held part of the city. Alessandra Vellucci said on Tuesday that the Castello Road considered the only access in and out of eastern Aleppo has been rendered ""impassable"" since hostilities there worsened last week. Vellucci said the U.N. estimates that 300000 people depend on the road which allows for the flow of supplies goods and civilians into the area. She said the U.N. continues to receive ""distressing reports of aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian locations in both western and eastern Aleppo."" She called on all sides to protect civilians and ease access for humanitarian access to all. Al-Jazeera reporter killed in Russian airstrikes in Idlib A reporter from Al-Jazeera was killed in a Russian airstrike in a town near the northeastern province of Idlib on Monday the news outlet reported on Monday.

US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining ""internal and external information"" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes.

1919191742,Fatalities expected to increase in suicide blast in Syria,27 Jul 2016 At least 48 people dead over 100 injured after truck bomb exploded near security headquarters in the city of Qamishli Hasaka. A man walks by a damaged site after bomb blasts claimed by DAESH hit the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli near the Turkish border. July 27 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb blast in the Syrian city of Qamishli on Wednesday killed 48 people and left dozens more wounded. The attack is believed to be among the deadliest in the city for years the British-based Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights said. A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate. My god! Look at the devastation from this terrorist attack in Qamishli. My prayers are with the victims. pic.twitter.comezhmZ1GOG4 Leith Abou Fadel (leithfadel) July 27 2016 State TV rolled footage from the scene of the blast showing large-scale damage to buildings vast amounts of rubble strewn across the road with plumes of smoke rising. The explosion was so powerful that it shattered windows in shops in the nearby Turkish town of Nusaybin which is directly across the border from where the blast occurred. Two people were slightly hurt in Nusaybin a witness said. The attack was claimed by DAESH. The assault against DAESH in the city of Manbij near the Turkish border has put it under pressure cutting off all routes out of the city. Fighters from the US-backed alliance have recently made incremental advances as they try to flush out the remaining DAESH fighters in Manbij. DAESH has previously targeted Qamishli and the provincial capital Hasaka city with bombs. A suicide blast killed six members of the Kurdish internal security force known as the Asayish in April. In July a suicide bomb killed at least 16 people in Hasaka. Kurdish forces control much of Hasaka province after capturing vast areas from the DAESH in 2015.

1919191744,US-led air strikes in Syria kill dozens of civilians,"21 Jul 2016 Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed by US-led air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

Syrians walk past an empty vegetable market in the rebel-held area of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on July 10 2016 after the regime closed the Castello Road severing the supply route to the opposition-held eastern half of the city. (TRT World and Agencies) Syrian rebel forces advanced into a key regime-held district in Aleppo on Monday to reopen the last remaining supply route into opposition-held districts. The offensive to gain control of the strategic Castello Road in the Al Mallah district came at dawn just days after the area was encircled by regime forces. Control over the Castello Road is the only way that some 250000 besieged residents of east Aleppo can have access to essentials like food and fuel. The regimes capture of the district days ago had come during an extension of a nationwide truce declared last week by the regime to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr. The regime which has been gaining ground on the rebels after Russia launched air strikes in support of regime leader Bashar al Assads forces last year have continued to step up their military campaigns on major battle fronts this month despite periodically announcing temporary truces.

(AFP) Residents contacted in the city say prices of the little remaining vegetables bread and fuel had almost doubled in the past week with no new supplies coming into Aleppo Syrias largest city and commercial hub before the war. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air raids by regime forces on the opposition-held part of Aleppo killed 13 civilians on Monday. It also said that 19 regime fighters were killed in the fighting. Aleppo has bore the brunt of the war which began in 2011 after regime forces led a crackdown on anti-regime protesters. The war has since killed more than 300000 people with some estimates suggesting 470000 may have died. A series of peace talks were brokered by the UN in February to bring peace to Aleppo and other parts of the country but long-lasting ceasefires have not held.

Because it is them who have produced and given their contributrion to making sure at least for two months that the ceasefire was agreed upon"" he said referring to the cessation of hostilities deal. On the other hand the main Syrian opposition body the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) told the UN envoy that it was premature to set a date for fresh talks in which outlines of a political deal will be presented something Mistura is seeking ahead of an August deadline. ""There is a need to adopt a new strategy to push the peace process by adopting a tougher policy against the regimes violations against the Syrian people ... before calling for a new round of negotiations"" the HNC statement said.

1919191753,Gas attack hits rebel-held areas of Aleppo report,11 Aug 2016 According to the Al-Quds hospital four people died while over 50 were injured in the attack. A man breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital. A hospital and a civil defence group said a gas what they believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) At least four people died and many suffered breathing difficulties when gas believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo on Wednesday a hospital and a civil defence group said. Hamza Khatib the manager of Al-Quds hospital in Aleppo told a Reuters photographer the hospital had recorded four deaths from gas poisoning and 55 injuries. Seven people were still receiving hospital treatment. Khatib said he was preserving pieces of patients clothing and fragments from the barrel bombs as evidence for analysis. Syria Civil Defence a Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said it had recorded three deaths and 22 injuries after a barrel containing a gas suspected of being chlorine fell on the Zubdiya neighbourhood of rebel-held Aleppo. Civilians brought to the Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) The group which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers said it could not independently verify the nature of the gas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a war monitor said helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al Dawla and Zubdiya leading to the death of a woman and her child from suffocation. The northern city of Aleppo Syrias most populous before the war is split into rebel- and regime-held districts. Capturing the whole city would be a major prize for Syrias Bashar al-Assad in the countrys five-year-old conflict. A fierce battle for control of the city broke out on Friday when rebels staged a major assault to break through a month-long regime siege of the citys rebel-held east where about 300000 people are thought to be living. Fighters managed to pierce the ring of regime-controlled territory but a safe corridor for civilians and aid has not yet been established. There have been unconfirmed reports among activists and residents of chlorine gas falling on rebel-held east Aleppo since the rebel offensive. The Aleppo Media Centre an online opposition news portal for the city posted a video that it said was of victims of the gas attack a child and adults wearing breathing apparatus. Two men interviewed said barrel bombs were dropped and there was a strong smell of gas. People then began to suffer breathing and eye problems. A boy breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) Western powers say the Syrian regime has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government has accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian regime agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulphur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.

""Today the news is awful"" Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. French President Francois Hollande accused Assad regime of responsibility for a ""massacre"". ""Once again the Syrian regime will deny the evidence of its responsibility for this massacre"" Hollande said in a statement. The White House also blamed the attack on the regime saying the incident was ""reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilised world."" ""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administrations weakness and irresolution"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also condemned the attack saying those responsible should be ""held to account."" Drawing criticism from around the world Idlib was also trending globally on social media site Twitter. Russia denies involvement Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Tuesdays attack Turkish presidential sources said. ""President Erdogan touched on the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Idlib. President Erdogan said such inhumane attacks are unacceptable"" a statement from top residential sources said. However Russia has categorically denied any involvement. ""Planes of the Russian air force have not carried out any strikes near Khan Shaykhun of Idlib province"" said a statement by the Russias defence ministry.

""The National Coalition demands the [UN] Security Council convene an emergency session ... open an immediate investigation and take the necessary measures to ensure the officials perpetrators and supporters are held accountable"" the body said in a statement.

(TRT World and Agencies) Air strikes by Syrian regime on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. A witness at the town hospital said he saw many wounded people their faces bloodied. All the facilitys beds were occupied by men women and children. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. Devastating regime siege The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating regime siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of regime leader Bashar Al Assad. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime.

(TRT World and Agencies) Air strikes have struck Syrias town of Urum al-Joz in rebel-controlled Idlib province on Saturday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Civil Defence rescue service. The attack believed to have been carried out by Russian aircraft killed at least 18 people including five children said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise it added. The Civil Defence service said that the two air raids on the town on Saturday afternoon have killed 19 and wounded 22. Pressure mounts on Assad Turkey remains committed to a ceasefire in Syria but Russia must stop insisting that Bashar al Assad should remain in office Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Sunday. Cavusoglu also said he told his Russian counterpart that Moscow did not take the necessary steps in the face of breaches in the Syrian ceasefire. Meanwhile Iraqs influential Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr also called on the regimes leader to step down and spare his country further bloodshed. Sadr who commands a large following among the urban poor of Baghdad and the southern cities is the first Iraqi Shia political leader to urge Assad to step down. Defeating Daesh The top priority for the United States in Syria is to defeat Daesh Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a TV interview on Sunday. ""Once Daesh threat has been reduced or eliminated I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilising the situation in Syria"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson cancelled a visit to Moscow scheduled for April 10 after the poison gas attack in Syria. The decision by Johnson to cancel the visit to Moscow later this month shows a lack of understanding of events in Syria Russias Foreign Ministry said on Sunday. The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian backers have vowed to keep up the fight against ""terrorists"" despite threats of further US strikes against the regime following the chemical attack. The US launched a cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base in response to the attack on Friday. Scores of people died and many were injured on Tuesday after the regime air strike dropped chemical bombs onto the town of Khan Shaykhun. But the regime has denied any responsibility saying its air strikes hit a rebel depot containing chemical materials.

1919191766,Multiple Daesh suicide bombers attack refugee camp in Syria,"2 May 2017 At least 24 people were killed on Tuesday in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian regime or Russian air strikes in and around a town in opposition-held Idlib province on Tuesday killed 26 people and severely damaged a hospital a monitoring group said. The attacks came as Syrian regime forces and Russian jets intensified their bombardment of Idlib the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. A spokesman at the hospital in Kafr Takharim in Idlib said an air strike hit its courtyard killing 14 people including patients. Separate air strikes southwest of Kafr Takharim killed at least 12 people including civilians and rebel fighters the Observatory said. The United Nations condemned the air strikes and called for an end to such attacks on hospitals. ""It is completely unacceptable that facilities and people who are trying to save lives are being bombed"" said Kevin Kennedy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis. ""It must stop"" he added. The Observatory said there were no deaths from the hospital strike but that the bombardment had put it out of action. Idlib is an opposition stronghold one of the few large areas still under rebel control in the west of the country. Rebels and their families who have chosen to leave areas under regime siege around Damascus in evacuation deals have headed for Idlib.

A boy who was injured during a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo on Saturday sits inside a tent connected to Bab al-Hawa hospital near the Syrian-Turkish border Syria April 18 2017 (File photo) (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb killed six people and wounded more than 30 in Syrias second city Aleppo on Wednesday the Assad regimes official television channel reported. The blast hit the southwestern neighbourhood of Salaheddin which was on the front line between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al Assads forces retook full control of the city in December. The attack took place as evacuations of civilians from conflict zones resumed after a four-day pause. About 45 buses carrying 3000 people left the opposition-besieged al-Foua and Kefraya towns of the northwestern Idlib province for regime-controlled Aleppo. Meanwhile a convoy of 11 buses left regime-besieged al-Zabadani near the capital Damascus for opposition-controlled territory a military media unit linked to the pro-regime Hezbollah group said. ""The area of Zabadani is empty of militants after the last batch of them left this morning"" the pro-regime Sham FM radio reported citing a senior regime official in Zabadani. Three buses on Wednesday also carried people who were injured in a convoy attack as they were being transferred from al-Foua and Kefraya on Saturday as well as the remains of those who had died in the attack the Hezbollah military media unit said. Saturdays convoy attack killed 126 people including more than 60 children the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-regime fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two towns. The attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by regime ally Iran and opposition backer Qatar to be halted. Under the deal more than 30000 people will be evacuated from four Syrian towns in two stages.

(TRT World and Agencies) A suicide car bomb has hit a convoy of buses carrying civilians out of two besieged Syrian towns killing at least 100 people and wounding several others. The explosion took place at a transit point Rashideen area as thousands of evacuees from the regime-held predominantly Shia towns of Foua and Kefraya waited on Saturday to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the Observatory said. It warned that the death toll was likely to rise given the ""several dozen wounded"" at the blast site. People who were evacuated from the two villages of Kefraya and Foua wait near buses after a stall in an agreement between the opposition and Syrian regime army at Rashideen. (TRT World and Agencies) More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from opposition-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Thousands of evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were also stuck in regime-controlled Ramusa south of Aleppo. The evacuation brokered by regime ally Iran and rebel backer Qatar is set to see more than 30000 people evacuated in two stages. The deal to evacuate the towns was the latest in a string of such agreements touted by the rebels as the best way to end the fighting. The opposition says they have been forced out by the siege and bombardment.

1923102821,Suicide bomber kills 16 in Syrias Hasakah,"Date of publication 5 July 2016 The bomber was on a motorcycle when he attacked a crowd outside a bakery. ""A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Salihiah neighbourhood of Hasakah city"" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights adding that 15 of the wounded were in critical condition. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack which it claimed targeted Kurdish forces. Kurdish police put the death toll at 16 earlier. Nearly all of Hasakah province is controlled by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) who have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they hold. The YPG is regarded by the Pentagon as the most effective fighting force against IS on the ground in Syria. Meanwhile fighting between Islamic State militants and a Kurdish-Arab alliance troops has forced 13000 residents to flee the IS-bastion city of Manbij. ""The fleeing increased after the Syrian Democratic Force [SDF] besieged Manbij"" on June 10 the head of the Syrian Observatory said. ""Hundreds of people fled a southern district of the town where there have been fierce clashes in recent days"". The US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance seized a key road junction and grain silos overlooking the city last week pushing further into the Islamic State group stronghold. The city lies close to the border with Turkey and is a key staging post on the extremists supply line to areas under its control in eastern Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The militants took an estimated 900 Kurdish civilians hostage in areas under their control west of the city according to the Observatory and Kurdish officials. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including al-Qaeda rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and the IS group.

1923102823,Bombs continue to fall on Syria despite regime truce,"Date of publication 7 July 2016 Video More than 33 people were killed in Syrian regime and Russian bombing on Wednesday despite Damascus promises of a truce to mark the Muslim Eid holidays. Syrian regime Manbij human rights truce Eid Syrian opposition territories were bombed on Wednesday hours after the Syrian regime announced a nationwide ceasefire for three days. Rebel-held areas in Aleppo and Idlib provinces were bombed despite Damascus promise of a 72-hours Eid al-Fitr truce. Three children were killed in five separate air raids on Jisr al-Shigour in Idlib province while a car bomb exploded outside a mosque in the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Other air raids took place in Aleppo while clashes between rebels and regime fighters continued across the day. A total of 33 people died according to the Local Coordination Committees with Russian and regime war planes both suspected. Regime advances cut the only road leading to rebel-held parts of Aleppo in the firing range cutting it off on Thursday. ""Currently nobody can get in or out of Aleppo"" a member of the Aleppo-based rebel group Fastaqim told Reuters. ""[The road] was not risk-free but now there is not a matter of danger now the road is cut"" Zakaria Malahjifi said. Rebel forces are battling to push back regime advances. [Click to enlarge] ""All the factions sent reinforcements and are trying to take back the positions taken by the government but the situation is very bad there was heavy government air cover in the night"" another rebel official told Reuters. It is estimated that between 250000 and 300000 people live in areas held by the opposition in Aleppo according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Ghouta a rebel-held area in the Damascus suburbs regime artillery hit Douma city while clashes continued between rebel and regime fighters in Daraa Latakia and Homs. Meanwhile US-led coalition warplanes killed 56 civilians including 19 children in Manbij in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. Assault on Manbij Kurdish-led forces are continuing their assault on the Islamic State group stronghold in northern Syria and are slowly advancing in the southern districts of Manbij and seized a number of silos on Wednesday. Coalition aircraft which are supporting the Kurdish-Arab forces on the ground have conducted 325 air raids around Manbij since 21 May including 29 strikes in the past four days. This has helped anti-IS fighters to gain 1000 kilometres of territory and a foothold in Manbij which is an important supply route for the jihadi force. ""The SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] has repeatedly defeated [IS] attempts to punch a hole through the cordon"" said Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Colonel Christopher Garver on Wednesday. He said this pressure is forcing IS to bring in new recruits to defend the city from the Kurdish-Arab force. ""Weve seen [IS] fighters leaving these previously defended towns to attempt to reinforce Manbij"" Garver said. ""As the pressure increases against [IS] in Manbij they are demonstrating more desperation to keep [IS] strategic crossroads open for access outside Syria.""

1923102826,Scores of Syrian rebels killed over key Aleppo road,"Date of publication 10 July 2016 At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed during a major counter-offensive to recapture a critical supply route into Aleppo and break regime siege of the city which threatens 300000 civilians. Tags Castello road Syria Syrian regime UN siege Aleppo al-Nusra Front Ahrar al-Sham At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed in clashes with regime troops overnight during a failed bid to reopen the oppositions key supply route into Aleppo city. The fighters from the Faylaq al-Sham Islamist faction and al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front were killed trying to reopen the Castello Road which regime forces effectively severed on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The road was the only remaining supply route into the opposition-held east of Aleppo city which has been divided between government and rebel control since mid-2012. Government forces effectively severed the route on Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the Castello Road. The Observatory said there were deaths among government forces in the overnight fighting but had no immediate toll. ""The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed"" said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. Civilians face food shortages Syrian rebel forces are preparing for a major battle in Aleppo [Anadolu] Residents in Aleppo described shortages of basic goods after government troops advanced within firing range of the key Castello Road supply route. ""For two days the situation was calm I went to the market and I filled up my motorbike with gasoline. Today I couldnt even find a single tomato"" said Bilal Qaterji a local textile factory employee. ""Theres not a drop of fuel left because the Castello Road has been cut"" he told AFP. Residents in eastern Aleppo said they feared ongoing shortages if the Castello Road remained closed. ""I worry that the Castello Road will be cut for a long time it will lead to shortages of bread and other necessities"" said Ahmed Kanjou an unemployed father of four. Residents said prices were already rising and many were bracing for the possibility of a lengthy siege. Syrias government has been accused of using siege tactics to pressure rebel forces and the UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the method. Activists and rights groups including Doctors Without Borders [MSF] have reported deaths from starvation in some besieged areas.

1923102830,US-led coalition raids kill scores of civilians in Syria,Date of publication 18 July 2016 Syrian activist groups say airstrikes by the US-led coalition targeting areas controlled by the Islamic State group have killed at least 21 civilians. Airstrikes by the US-led coalition killed at least 21 civilians in and around a stronghold of the Islamic State group in northern Syria on Monday. At least 15 civilians were killed in raids in a northern district of Manbij while six others were killed in a village near the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The extremist bastion has faced more than a month-long US-backed offensive by Kurdish and Arab fighters that has caused thousands of civilians to flee. However tens of thousands of civilians are still trapped in Manbij most of which is controlled by the extremists. On June 23 the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into western districts of Manbij after blocking the road south of the city heading to ISs de facto capital of Raqqa. But their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the militants which are also fighting back by launching suicide attacks against the SDF. Founded in October the Kurdish-dominated alliance has seized territory from IS across large parts of northern and northeastern Syria. Capturing Manbij would be its most significant victory yet. Syrias war has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

1923102835,Dozens killed in bombardment on rebel-held Aleppo,"Date of publication 25 July 2016 Video Suspected Russian strikes hit several locations in rebel-held parts of Syrias Aleppo province including a market area in the early hours of Monday morning. Tags Aleppo Syria Assad Russia Attack Airstrikes At least 16 people were killed in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks on rebel-held parts of Syrias Aleppo province on Monday. Early on Monday morning multiple air raids believed to be Russian killed 10 civilians in the rebel-held Atareb town the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Footage showed the local civil defence unit attempting to put out a fire in the rubble of one collapsed building as civilians attempted to search for medicine from what seemed to be the remains of a pharmacy. Meanwhile six others were killed in government barrel bombs in the east of the city. The monitor which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of people with injuries and still trapped under the debris. The news follows earlier airstrike on Syrias Aleppo that hit four makeshift hospitals and a local blood bank. Sundays bombardment killed a two-day-old baby in the childrens hospital in a besieged eastern neighbourhood of Aleppo the Independent Doctors Association a group of Syrian doctors that supports clinics in the city said. The IDA said the four hospitals that were hit the childrens hospital al-Bayan al-Zahraa and al-Daqaq would all be going out of service ""as a result of the escalating series of aerial attacks taking place against health facilities in Aleppo by Syrian and Russian warplanes"". The World Health Organisation said Syria was the most dangerous place for health care workers to operate last year with 135 attacks on health facilities and workers in 2015. In recent months several hospitals have been damaged and medical staff killed in the densely populated eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo city. A hospital in the eastern Maadi neighbourhood was hit just eight days ago wounding some of the staff and patients inside.

1923102842,Seven children killed in Syrias rebel-held Aleppo,"Date of publication 5 August 2016 Air raids on Aleppos Marjeh district killed at least 10 people including seven children on Friday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports. Tags Aleppo siege Syria Islamic State Syrian Democratic Forces At least 10 people including seven children were killed in airstrikes on the rebel-held east of Aleppo city on Friday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The Britain-based group said it was unclear if the raids on Aleppos Marjeh district were carried out by aircraft belonging to the Syrian government or its ally Russia. The latest civilian deaths come as the rebels press on with an assault intended to break a government siege of opposition-held Aleppo that began on July 17 and has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis. The assault started on Sunday and is targeting the Ramussa district that contains the main supply route to the government-held west of the city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. After some initial advances government forces backed by Russian airstrikes have pushed back opposition fighters which include extremists from al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. According to the Observatory at least 112 civilians including 33 children have been killed in Aleppo since the rebel assault began on Sunday. The deaths include 65 people among them 22 children killed in rebel fire on government neighbourhoods the Observatory said. Another 42 people including 11 children have been killed in strikes on eastern Aleppo the monitor said. It reported five more deaths in rebel fire on the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud district of the city. Elsewhere in the Aleppo province the monitor said an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters were advancing inside the Islamic State [IS] bastion of Manbij. Observatory chief Rami Abdul Rahman said the Syrian Democratic Forces [SDF] now held 70 percent of the town. ""The Islamic State has entered its final phase in the town of Manbij"" he told AFP adding however that IS was keeping a number of civilians there as human shields. ""The progress the SDF has made in the last week is more than it was able to achieve in previous weeks put together."" The SDF began an assault on Manbij in late May and entered the town on June 23 with support from the US-led coalition against IS. Manbij sits on the route between the Turkish border and the eastern city of Raqqa the extremists de facto capital in Syria.

Tags MSF Syria Idlib Russia A hospital funded by medical charity Medcins Sans Frontieres [MSF] in a rebel-held province of northern Syria was destroyed by airstrikes over the weekend that killed 13 people MSF said on Monday. Among the dead were four staff and five children. ""The direct bombing of another hospital in Syria is an outrage said Silvia Dallatomasina MSFs medical manager of operations in northwest Syria while also calling for an immediate end to attacks on hospitals in Syrias war. MSF said that the hospital in Millis Idlib province was hit directly by two airstrikes that forced the closure of the medical facility. The hospital served as a referral centre specialising in pediatrics with an operating theatre and an intensive care unit. MSF did not specify which government was behind the attacks however Russia was on Monday accused of dropping phosphorous bombs on central Idlib late Sunday night. The bombings came as rebel groups on the ground prepared for fresh assaults on regime positions. The medical charity said that the attack has deprived around 70000 people in Millis and the surrounding towns of medical care as it used to cater for up to 250 people a day. Hospitals have been regularly targeted in Syrias conflict with the UN recording 44 attacks in July alone on medical facilities in the war-torn country. The government of President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Moscow have denied bombing hospitals in their campaigns against rebel groups. According to MSF two medical centres that it supports in Idlib have reported a total of nice mass influxes of injured people in July. In this month alone 466 patients have been reported as wounded and 37 have died. These same rebel-controlled facilities reported 294 wounded and 33 dead in a total of seven mass influxes for the first six months of 2016.

Tags Syria Raqqa Aleppo Russia United Nations human rights Islamic State ISIS At least 30 people including 24 civilians were killed by Russian airstrikes targeting the Islamic State [IS] group bastion of Raqqa in northern Syria on Thursday. Dozens more were wounded when ten Russian raids hit the city and its outskirts. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had not yet confirmed how many of the remaining six people killed were civilians or IS militants. The Britain-based monitor says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Russia confirmed that six Tupolev warplanes carried out airstrikes around Raqqa but said it had demolished ""a chemical weapons factory in the citys northwestern outskirts."" The defence ministry said the raids also destroyed a weapons storage facility and a training camp for IS fighters to the north and southeast. The ministry said that the extremists had suffered ""significant material damages"" in the strikes and that ""a large number of fighters have been killed."" The raids comes a day after the ministry said it would halt fire around Syrias ravaged city of Aleppo for three hours each day to allow humanitarian aid in an initiative the United Nations said is insufficient to meet the citys needs. The UN has called for urgent aid access to Aleppo and 48-hour weekly pauses for the aid deliveries warning that civilians are at grave risk from water shortages and disease as fighting has intensified.

Those killed were believed to have inhaled chlorine gas and died from poisoning the manager of al-Quds hospital Hamza Khatib told Reuters news agency. At least 55 people were injured by the gas and Khatib had persevered evidence of the attack including patients clothing he told Reuters. Three deaths and 22 injuries were reported by the civil defence rescuers after barrels of gas believed to be chlorine were dropped on the Zubdiya neighbourhood in rebel-held Aleppo Reuters reported. A woman and a child died of suffocation after helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al-Dawla and Zubdiya the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Unconfirmed reports over the use of chlorine gas on rebel-held areas in eastern Aleppo emerged after the offensive on the city began in late June. Rebels and activists have reported barrel bombs containing poisonous gas were dropped on residential areas around Aleppo but the lack of chemical labs or independent testers made it difficult to verify these claims. A worlds chemical weapons watchdog raised concerns earlier this month over the reports of chlorine gas attacks around Aleppo. ""These reports are of great concern"" Ahmet Uzumcu the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] said in a statement. The UN-backed group based in The Hague ""continues to examine any credible reports"" of chemical weapons use the statement said. Uzumcu added that under international conventions the use of chemical weapons ""by anyone under any circumstances"" is seen ""as reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community.""

Diseases are spreading among residents threatening the lives of many. According to the United Nations there are currently 592700 people living under siege in Syria. The vast majority of this number some 452700 people are besieged by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In January the regimes siege of Madaya saw dozens die of starvation with mounting public pressure forcing the UN aid to act. Aid deliveries to the suburb have taken place but the amounts delivered have been short of what residents say is needed to sustain life.

Tags Aleppo civil defence UN airstrikes Russia Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday killing at least 18 people including children and two hospital staffers. The air raids hit the only hospital for women and children in the town of Kafr Hamra before dawn killing two staffers including a nurse. The Syrian Civil Defence a group of first responders said it pulled 10 people alive from under the rubble. Kafr Hamra is near the northern front line in the deeply divided city of Aleppo where government troops have sealed the main route into opposition areas effectively trapping nearly 300000 residents. The Syrian Civil Defence said one of its centres in the rebel-held part of Aleppo was hit. Pictures on the groups Facebook page showed serious damage to one of its vehicles and crumbling walls. The volunteer group said one of its most well-known members died after being buried under the rubble following a Wednesday airstrike in the Ramouseh area recently seized by rebels from government forces. Khaled Harah had recovered a live baby from a destroyed building in Aleppos Sukkari neighbourhood in 2014 following a 16-hour rescue effort.

1923102855,Syrian regime bombs Kurdish fighters for second day,"Date of publication 19 August 2016 The uneasy peace in Syrias Hassakeh city was broken two days ago as clashes between regime and Kurdish forces escalated leading to Damascus to bomb separatist positions. Tags Qamishli Rojava Hassakeh Kurdish Syrian-Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units Turkey Syrian regime Syrian regime warplanes bombed Kurdish positions in the north-eastern city of Hassakeh on Friday as fighting between the two sides continued for a second day. The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units. Agencies contributed to this story.

""Fifteen civilians among them 11 children were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the Bab al-Nayrab neighbourhood"" in the south of Aleppo city the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The group also reported eight civilians including two children were killed on Thursday in rebel fire on the government-held west of the city. An AFP journalist in Bab al-Nayrab saw rescue workers and civilians digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings. One man carried out the lifeless body of a baby no bigger than his forearm. The babys eyes were closed and its body was white with dust except for speckles and smears of blood. Elsewhere a civil defence worker protected the face of another dead child as his colleagues scraped away the rubble encasing the rest of the childs body. Syrias regime has been accused of regularly using barrel bombs crude explosive devices on rebel-held areas that are home to civilians and other parties to the conflict are not known to have used the weapons. President Bashar al-Assad and his government deny using barrel bombs. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011. The city has been roughly divided between rebel control in the east and government control in the west since mid-2012 with each side bombarding the other and causing civilian casualties.

Al-Waer neighbourhood is the last remaining rebel-held district in Homs following a truce between the opposition and the regime in the city in 2014. Residents of Daraya near Damascus had previously accused Russian aircraft of using napalm bombs in attacks on the area. Sibai added that regime warplanes also launched an air road of fourteen missiles on the neighborhood wounding dozens of civilians including women and children. Meanwhile a Russian warplane targeted north of Idlib city with four airstrikes including two cluster bombs killing three civilians and severely injuring a dozen people according to media activist Musafa Abu Mohammad.

1923102863,7 killed in regime strikes on besieged Homs neighbourhood,"Date of publication 29 August 2016 Airstrikes kill seven and wound dozens more in the last rebel-held area in Syrias third city of Homs. Tags Syria Homs Seige Napalm Incendiary bombs Jets thought to belong to the Syrian government struck the the besieged Al-Waer neighborhood in the city of Homs on Sunday residents and a monitor said. According to Reuters over a dozen airstrikes on the residential area killed at least seven people and injured dozens more civilians. A woman and a child were also among the dead the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights said. Videos and images also emerged on social media showing children afflicted by burns that activists say were caused by incendiary weapons. This escalation in attacks came a day after the Damascus suburb of Daraya was evacuated by rebels after relentless bombing and a tough siege. The strikes were the first of their kind on Homs rebel-held areas in a year. In December local leaders and the government agreed a UN-sponsored deal that would see fighters evacuated and the regime take control of the city. No progress has been seen on this plan which requires local resistors to surrender their heavy weapons. Prior to this a truce in Homs in 2014 allowed for the withdrawal of fighters from the Old City leaving al-Waer in rebel hands. Since then the neighbourhood has been choked by a seige enforced by government troops and loyalist militias. This has blocked deliveries of all supplies of aid to the area save a few UN-led deliveries. An estimated 50000 civilians are currently trapped in Al-Waer alongside several thousand fighters. The seige on Al-Waer is part of what Washington has decried as Damascus ""surrender-or-starve"" tactic of beseiging rebel-controlled areas into capitulation or death.

Tags Syria Idlib Russia airstrikes Syrian regime Bashar Assad Airstrikes on a rebel-held village in northwest Syria killed 12 people and put a nearby field clinic out of service early on Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said a first round of raids which were likely carried out by Russian jets targeted the village of Duwayleh in the Idlib province. ""Twelve people were killed including at least two rebel fighters and five civilians"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. ""As they were bringing wounded people to the clinic in nearby Kafr Takharim new airstrikes hit near the facility"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. ""They put the hospital out of service because of damage to its structure and to the equipment"" he said. It was the second medical facility in rebel-held Idlib province to be targeted in four days after a warplane on Saturday severely damaged a makeshift hospital set up in a cave. That bombardment near the opposition-controlled village of Abdeen wounded five medical staff according to the Observatory. The World Health Organization has called Syria the worlds most dangerous place for health workers. The province of Idlib has been under the control of rebel and extremist groups since spring 2015 and is regularly bombarded by both Syrian and allied Russian warplanes. In early April at least 88 civilians were killed in a suspected chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun a town further south in Idlib province.

Tags Syria Idlib gas attack chlorine Observatory Assad Warplanes carried out a suspected toxic gas attack that killed at least 72 people including several children in a rebel-held town in northwestern Syria on Tuesday a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province had died from the effects of the gas adding that dozens more suffered respiratory problems and other symptoms. The Britain-based monitoring group was unable to confirm the nature of the substance and said it was unclear if the planes involved in the attack were Syrian or those of government ally Russia. The Observatory said medical sources in the town reported symptoms among the affected including fainting vomiting and foaming at the mouth. The victims were mostly civilians it said and included at least 20 children. Photographs circulated by activists showed members of the volunteer White Helmets rescue group using hoses to wash down the injured as well as at least two men with white foam around their mouths. Idlib province is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. A man gets treatment at a hospital after the chlorine gas attack in Idlib [Anadolu] It is regularly targeted in strikes by the regime as well as Russian warplanes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group usually targeting extremists. Syrias government officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use by the government since then with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The government denies the use of chemical weapons and has in turn accused rebels of using banned weapons. The attack comes only days after forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were accused of using chemical weapons in a counter-offensive in neighbouring Hama province. The opposition accused the government forces of using ""toxic substances"" in its battle to repel the assault. On Thursday airstrikes on several areas in the north of Hama province left around 50 people suffering respiratory problems according to the Observatory which could not confirm the cause of the symptoms. The monitor relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used.

1923102873,Syrian regime airstrikes kill 22 civilians near Damascus,"Date of publication 3 April 2017 At least 22 civilians have been killed by Syrian regime airstrikes on the outskirts of Damascus on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Tags Syria Damascus Douma Regime Rebels Civilians Bashar al-Assad Airstrikes Syrian regime airstrikes on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 which has trapped over 300000 civilains and is targeted regularly by airstrikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. The World Health Organization last week demanded immediate humanitarian access to the area saying residents are in desperate need of medical attention. Time is running out for the people of East Ghouta. As health needs increase available resources are being depleted day by day. Our main goal now is to provide access to lifesaving care for thousands of vulnerable men women and children immediately said Elizabeth Hoff WHO Representative in Syria. All 3 public hospitals and 17 public health care centres in East Ghouta are nonfunctioning and inaccessible to the population the WHO said in a statement. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

Hundreds of people were killed in Eastern Ghouta in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops in August 2013. On Tuesday at least 58 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun according to the Observatory.

1923102875,Syrian airbase struck by US missiles Whats the damage?,"Date of publication 7 April 2017 A salvo of US cruise missiles have severely damaged a Syrian regime airbase that was used as a launchpad for a devastating chemical attack on an opposition village in Idlib. Tags Shayrat cruise missiles US Homs Idlib Khan Sheikhun Fifty nine US cruise missiles struck a Syrian regime airbase in Homs province early Friday morning which appears to have caused severe damage to the infamous military site. Shayrat Airfield was allegedly the launch pad for a devastating chemical attack on an Idlib village that left up to a hundred civilians dead including scores of women and children. A potent symbol of regime oppression the airfield has been used for countless air raids on civilian targets and the second largest airbase in Syria. It now appears to be inoperable after sustaining severe damage from the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by two US destroyers. ""All aircraft located there have been damaged you can say it is completely destroyed"" regime TV reported while state news agency SANA said that six people were killed in the attack. Pro-regime media have reported that 15 regime fighter planes were destroyed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sukhoi-22s Sukhoi-24s and MiG-23s were based there. [click to enlarge] Russia was given prior warning by the US which likely prevented the killing of large numbers of air and ground crew but it appears some were caught by the missiles. Dozens of regime personnel were reported killed or injured in the attack with damage to air defences housing for officers and a fuel depot according to the observatory. Although it appears the airfield will no longer be used for more bombings by regime planes the regime still has many options while Russia still maintains the huge Hmeimem airbase in Latakia. The brief lull in regime bombing should still provide some relief for the civilians of Idlib.

1923102878,Strike on Syrias Idlib kills 18 including five children,Date of publication 8 April 2017 An airstrike by Russian warplanes on Saturday killed 18 people including five children and two women in the rebel stronghold of Urom al-Joz in Syrias Idlib province. Tags Syria Idlib airstrike Russian human rights Homs bombing Islamic State At least 18 civilians including five children and two women were killed in an airstrike on Syrias northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urum al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions. The Britain-based Observatory said the strike was likely to have been carried out by Russian war jets which operate in support of the Syrian regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assads regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assads regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning. In return Moscow announced it would ramp up air defences in Syria in an attempt to show a tough line on the US actions. Bus bombing in Homs province Also on Saturday Syrian state TV reported a bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near the central city of Homs killing a woman and wounding 25. It gave no further details about the explosion but the governor of Homs province Talal Barrazi told AP the bomb was placed inside a bus that transports workers at a private factory. The Observatory confirmed a woman was killed in the blast saying it also wounded more than 20 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State group have carried out similar attacks in the past. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations.

1923102880,Sarin nerve gas used in Syria British scientists,"Date of publication 13 April 2017 British scientists concluded that sarin or a sarin-like substance was used in the chemical attack in Syria the ambassador to the United Nations said on Wednesday. Tags Syria Russia Chemical Attack British scientists said sarin or a sarin-like substance was used in the suspected chemical attack in Syria the British ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday. ""Samples obtained from Khan Sheikhun"" where the attack took place have ""tested positive for the nerve agent sarin or a sarin-like substance"" Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the UN Security Council pinning the blame on the regime of Bashar al-Assad. ""The United Kingdom therefore shares the US assessment that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for a sarin attack on Khan Sheikhun on the 4th of April"" Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the UN Security Council. On Tuesday similar results were confirmed by Turkish health officials who said post-mortem tests on victims of the suspected attack concluded that the deadly sarin nerve agent had been used. The results came from analysis of blood and urine samples of the casualties from the attack in Idlib province who were brought to Turkey for treatment - three of which died in hospital. At least 87 people including 31 children died in the suspected attack that the West blames on Syria President Bashar al-Assads forces. However Russias Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov cast doubt on the British findings saying he was ""amazed at this conclusion."" ""No one has yet visited the site"" he asserted. ""How do you know that?"" Russia a key ally of Syrias Bashar al-Assad has called for a thorough investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) of the allegations of chemical weapons use in Khan Sheikhun.

Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime accused by Washington of using starvation as a weapon of war. Opposition fighters unleashed a barrage of rockets on the government-held western side of the divided city on Friday as they announced a major offensive aimed at reopening vital supply lines. ""In just a few days we will open the way for our besieged brothers"" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP. The rebel fire has killed at least 21 civilians including two children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Aleppo where rebels have been making advances"" the British-based monitoring group which has a network of sources on the ground said Saturday. More than 1500 fighters from the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib to the west were attacking government-controlled districts of the city along a front stretching for 15 kilometres (nine miles) it said. The Observatory reported Russian air raids on Aleppos western front lines but said that a halt to Moscows aerial bombing of the rebel-held east of the city was holding. An AFP correspondent who visited Dahiyet al-Assad where rebels seized ground on Friday saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings as airstrikes and artillery fire hit the area. Fierce fighting shelling and car bombs killed at least 18 regime forces and allied fighters on Friday according to Observatory which was unable to provide a toll for the rebels. More than 250000 people live under government siege in the eastern half of Aleppo which the army began an operation to retake several weeks ago. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people.

Tags Aleppo Idlib Syria education children At least six children were killed and 15 injured in rebel rocket attacks in the government-held west of Aleppo city on Thursday just a day after deadly airstrikes on a school complex in Idlib left 35 people including 22 children dead. The rocket fire in Aleppo hit two neighbourhoods in the west of the city with one of the attacks striking a school. ""Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo"" state news agency SANA reported. It added that the attack also damaged the school. A second rocket attack hit a house in the Hamdaniyeh neighbourhood killing three brothers and injuring a fourth SANA said. The two neighbourhoods are in the west of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Syrian rebels regularly target west Aleppo with airstrikes with civilian deaths as a result of such strikes not uncommon. Recently on October 13 Syrian state media reported that four people had been killed in rebel shelling of a school in the Sulemaniyeh district of west Aleppo. Since late September Syrian regime forces backed by Russia have embarked on an intense aerial and ground campaign aimed at recapturing east Aleppo. Hundreds of people have been killed in attacks that have also targeted hospitals and water infrastructures in the area. According to Save the Children more than 4200 schools in Syria have been damaged destroyed militarised and used as detention centres or been converted into shelters for internally displaced in near six years of conflict. In September 2015 the humanitarian organisation reported that half of all attacks on schools worldwide between 2011 and 2015 had occurred in Syria. On Wednesday the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in airstrikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass. Moscow denied any involvement in the raids. The British-based Observatory which has a network of sources in Syria gave a toll of 36 dead among them 15 children and four teachers. The incident prompted outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly.

1923102890,Idlib bombing deadliest school attack in Syrias war,"Date of publication 27 October 2016 Airstrikes targeting a school complex in the town of Hass in Idlib province around noon on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began. The UN Childrens agency (UNICEF) said on Thursday that airstrikes targeting a school in Syrias rebel-held northern Idlib province early on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began nearly six years ago. Both first responders the Syrian Civil Defence and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have reported that 35 people were killed by the attack which struck a school complex in the village of Hass around midday on Wednesday as children gathered outside preparing to return home. Among the dead were 22 children. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake has called the airstrikes an ""outrage"" tantamount to a war crime."" The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets have said that the attack constituted a double tap. This occurs when a warplane carries out an initial bombing raid on a target and then waits for either signs of survivors or rescue workers to arrive before executing a second or more consequent attacks. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" said a local activist speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year. In the last week as Syrian and Russian airstrikes over Aleppo have temporarily calmed amid a Russian-proposed humanitarian pause in the city airstrikes on rebel positions have increased in Idlib as the Syrian regime seeks to stymie opposition gains in the province.

Airstrikes on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province hit a school and the surrounding area on Wednesday killing at least 26 civilians including many children a monitor and activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ""warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes"" in the village of Hass including on a school complex. The Britain-based Observatory which monitors Syrias five-year conflict said at least 11 children were among the 26 civilians killed. A complex of 3 schools was targeted in by many airstrikes including a double tap. Initial reports of 20+ killed & many injured. The White Helmets civil defence group released pictures of four rescue workers clambering over a mound of rubble in search of survivors after what it said was a ""double-tap"" strike on the school. The raids hit Hass around 1130 am (0830 GMT) an activist with the opposition Idlib Media Centre told AFP. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" the activist said speaking on condition of anonymity. Other activists from the province circulated a photograph on social media of a childs arm seared off above the elbow still clutching the strap of a dusty black rucksack. Shaky video footage depicted rescue workers sprinting towards the site of the raids and pulling a frail elderly man out of a collapsed building. The authenticity of the pictures and footage could not be independently verified. Syrian government forces and their Russian ally have been criticised by rights groups for indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure. Intentional attack A leading opposition group condemned the raids. The Istanbul-based National Coalition said Russian and regime warplanes ""targeted children in their schools deliberately and intentionally hitting civilians with high-explosive material."" Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and extremists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda earlier this year.

1923102896,Russia says Belgian strikes kill six in Aleppo region,"Date of publication 19 October 2016 Russia has accused Belgium of killing civilians in Aleppo while partaking in coalition strikes. Tags Belgium Syria coalition air raids strikes Aleppo Russia has accused Belgium a member of a US-led coalition fighting militants in Syria of killing six civilians in airstrikes in the Aleppo region but the claim was swiftly denied by Brussels. ""Six people were killed and four people injured to various degrees as a result of bombing that destroyed two homes"" in the village of Hassajik in the Aleppo region early on Tuesday the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. ""Two of Belgiums F-16s were identified at that time in the region"" it said late Tuesday. ""There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region."" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the countrys air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements ""strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians"". ""I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN"" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

Tags Syria Aleppo Azaz Rebels Car Bomb Islamic State At least 20 people were killed in a car bomb blast at an opposition checkpoint in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo on Thursday local sources said. The blast hit near the town of Azaz close to the border with Turkey local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab adding that rebels manning the checkpoint and civilians waiting to get through were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 of the dead were rebels. The attack also injured dozens and the monitor said the toll could rise further because of the number of people with serious wounds. The checkpoint was run by the Shamiya Front rebel group which is active in Aleppo province and was on the road to the Bab al-Salama crossing. The blast caused huge devastation and most of the injured were taken across the border to the nearby Turkish hospitals Mohammad al-Halabi added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which al-Halabi believes bares the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. IS has regularly targeted rebel factions with bomb attacks including an October 6 attack at a border crossing in neighbouring Idlib province that killed 29 rebels.

Elsewhere a purported deal has been reached that will see rebels evacuated to Idlib from the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya. More than a dozen airstrikes had been carried out overnight in rebel-held districts of east Aleppo amid ongoing bombardment of the area by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets reported on Thursday that 13 people had been killed and 25 injured in airstrikes with defence teams still looking under rubble for survivors. Relentless bombardment According to the Halab Today TV station cluster munitions were deployed over east Aleppo while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that clashes had taken place between pro-regime forces and rebels in Aleppos northern suburbs. Over 350 civilians have been killed in east Aleppo since a US-Russian brokered ceasefire collapsed on September 19 according to the UK-based monitor. An international meeting headed by the US and Russia is set to take place in Lausanne this Saturday aimed at curbing deadly violence in Syria with a particular focus on Aleppo where life in rebel-held districts of the city has been described as a ""merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe"".

Another evacuation deal in Damascus Meanwhile in Damascus reports emerged that a deal had been reached between the Syrian regime and rebel fighters in the suburb of Qudsaya that will see some 150 rebels and their families leave the area and be transferred to the north-western province of Idlib.

Tags Aleppo Syria UK Russia UK Parliament Bustan al-Qasr Russian forces returned to their intense aerial bombardment of rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Tuesday after several days of relative calm local residents have said. ""It was pretty calm in the previous few days said Abd Abu al-Nasr a resident of Aleppos Bustan al-Qasr district told The New Arab. ""But this morning it was pretty bad again with warplanes cannon and artillery shelling our neighbourhood. At least eight died including two children. Now the bombing is still all around us and the warplanes are still flying"". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the reports of bombing while local journalist Zouhir al-Shimale placed the death toll from the air raids at 50. Another resident living in the citys Ferdous neighbourhood reported that the bombing hit an area close to a sprawling residential area. Following the attack all local schools and shops were closed. Last week the Syrian regime and its Russian ally appeared to scale down air raids on Aleppo after hundreds were killed in a week of intense bombing. According to the Syrian regime this lull in violence was to allow civilians to ""escape"" from rebel-held neighbourhoods. Damascus has claimed that opposition fighters in the city will be allowed to leave with their families if put down their weapons but opposition groups have dismissed the offer as ""trickery"". The Syrian regime has made it a key aim of recapturing Aleppo and a stronghold of anti-Assad sentiments. Russia has carried out airstrikes on the city and recently built up its forces in Syria following the collapse of the recent ceasefire which broke following the bombing of an aid convoy. Moscows air campaign in Syria has drawn heavy international criticism including accusations of war crimes. On Tuesday the UK Parliament convened in an emergency debate on the humanitarian situation in Aleppo. This meeting saw several British lawmakers call for alleged Russian war crimes to be investigated. ""The case against Russia and Syria is clear and backed by firm evidence. The UK government must add its weight to calls already being made by France and the US for an ICC [International Criminal Court] investigation"" said Welsh nationalist MP Hywel Williams. ""Plaid Cymru voted against bombing Syria. We were told that such bombing would be carefully controlled to exclude danger to civilians but it is clear that neither Russia nor Syria are taking such precautions. ""Indeed it seems as though they specifically target civilians. Taking them before the ICC for such actions would therefore be consistent with UK policy on air strikes.""

Clashes also broke out in several districts of Aleppo where pro-regime forces have started an offensive and are advancing on Salahuddin and Bureij.

Assads comments made during an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2 came following an earlier statement on Thursday by Staffan de Mistura during which the UNs envoy to Syria pleaded with the al-Qaeda linked Fatah al-Sham to leave East Aleppo. The continued presence of Fatah al-Sham in Aleppo had been used as justification by the Syrian regime and its Russian backers for its ongoing bombardment of the city. But activists and Syrians say that Fatah al-Shams presence in the city is minimal and the group is being used as a pretext for Russia to carpet bomb civilian areas and hit the citys infrastructure.

""Two patients killed and eight injured due to four bombs dropped from a helicopter on QRCS medical facility"" the charity said in a statement. Managed by QRCS the health centre in al-Sakhoor area went out of service due to 50 percent damage to the building as a result of the bombing on Saturday. A local ambulance and other medical facilities supported by international NGOs were also affected by the attack. The charity condemned the attack and called on the international community to ""intervene and put an end to such direct attacks on medical and health facilities in Syria"". Dr. Hashem Darwish head of QRCSs health program in Turkey described the attack as a ""war crime"" and a violation of international accords that recognise the importance of protecting the Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies and humanitarian aid organisations in areas of conflict. Medical facilities and humanitarian professionals in Syria have not been spared the deadly scourge of the five-year conflict with ongoing attacks on hospitals and aid convoys that have left hundreds dead and others injured. Airstrikes targeting a UN-Arab Red Crescent aid convoy in the Aleppo suburb of Orum al-Kubra last month signalled the end of a US-Russian brokered ceasefire for Syria and consequent bombardment by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes on rebel-held districts of east Aleppo has seen two hospitals rendered out of service in the last week.

Last week MSFs international president condemned the United Nations for failing to take action over hospital bombings in Syria. Desperately needed health facilities had been ""horrifically transformed"" to places of death Dr Joanne Liu told the UN Security Council on Wednesday. Addressing the council Liu said Resolution 2286 passed in May by members to protect civilians and medical services they need to survive has ""plainly failed to take any effect on the ground"".

Tags Idlib Syria refugee camp Russian war planes air raid Syrian regime Five women and a child have been killed after Russian or Syrian regime war planes targeted a refugee camp in rebel stronghold Idlib province. Bombs and missiles struck the camp situated in southern Idlib province close to the village of al-Khwyn. The victims are thought to be refugees from elsewhere in Syria who fled to the rebel stronghold of Idlib. Frequent bombing by regime and Russian war planes have seen numerous massacres in Idlib province and have included refugee camps. In May a suspected Russian air raid on Sarmada refugee camp in Idlib province left dozens dead. The UN said it was unlikely that the attack was an accident and that the bombing could amount to a war crime. Last month nearly 1200 Syrian civilians were killed the Syrian Network for Human Rights claimed including 192 children and 163 women - mostly from air raids. ""Regime and Russian forces have violated human rights law that guarantee the right to life"" the Syrian Network for Human Rights commented. Aleppo has also witnessed massive air raids in recent weeks one of the most ferocious aerial assaults since the start of the war. with hundreds of civilians killed since the breakdown of a ceasefire last month.

Tags Syria Assad US Russia ceasefire Aleppo Suspected Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers including a senior official as well as killing and injuring a number of civilians local sources said late on Monday. The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. ""Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers"" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. 	 	Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement	 	 Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the ""White Helmets"" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. ""Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement"" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups ""did not commit to a single element"" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see ""no clear vision for the near future in the city"".

An adult and a child have been killed in Syrias Aleppo city in the first deaths in areas covered by a US-Russian-brokered ceasefire since it began this week. Mohammad Alaa Mesouti was killed in a rebel-held area on Thursday while a child whose name has not yet been released was killed in a regime-held area of the divided city local activists and monitoring groups said. ""Regime snipers positioned the al-Izaa district fired into the besieged Zabadieh district killing civilian Mohammad Alaa Mesouti and wounding three others"" media activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi added that a further two civilians were wounded in the Bustan al-Qasr district after regime troops shot into the rebel-held neighbourhood. An opposition source said that this was the first civilian casualty in Aleppo since the cessation of hostilities took effect three days ago. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has confirmed the civilian casualty in rebel-held Aleppo adding that a child was also killed in the regime-held al-Masharfeh district of the city by sniper fire. On Thursday 23 civilians including nine children were killed in regime air raids on a town in eastern Syria held by the Islamic State group [IS]. The truce does not include areas where IS and the former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fath al-Sham are present. US President Barack Obama will meet with security aides on Friday amid deep unease over the ceasefire deal. Barely a week since the US and Russia agreed to halt bombing and let humanitarian aid into Aleppo the deals shaky implementation looks set to dominate the meeting which was ostensibly about countering IS. The agreement has somewhat quieted the bombs over Syrias second city but aid convoys have not been allowed to reach the roughly 250000 civilians besieged by regime forces in the rebel-held east. Basic resources in rebel-held East Aleppo are beginning to run low according to The New Arabs correspondent in the city.

Tags Syria Airstrikes Truce Ceasefire Assad Rebels Aleppo At least five civilians were killed in aerial bombardment targeting a rebel-controlled neighbourhood east of Aleppo on Sunday as the opposition continued to mull over a US-Russia truce deal due to take effect on Monday. Dozens were injured when ""government helicopters targeted the residential area"" activist Mansoor Hussain told The New Arab noting that ""Qabr al-Engleezi was also hit by warplanes."" The reports come just a day after more than 100 civilians were killed in regime-bombardment on Idlip and Aleppo while five others were killed on the outskirts of the capital. ""People were shopping before the Eid al-Adha next week which is why the toll is so high"" said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman after Saturdays strikes. SOHR added that many of wounded are in severe condition and many others remain unaccounted for which is likely to increase the death toll. The Army of Conquest - led by the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after renouncing ties with al-Qaeda - is regularly bombarded by pro-government forces. Close to 500000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict first erupted in March 2011 and several attempts at securing a long-lasting truce have faltered. State news agency SANA on Saturday reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government ""approved the agreement"" brokered between US and Russia. Key regime ally Iran welcomed the plan on Sunday and called for ""comprehensive monitoring"" of the truce particularly along Syrias volatile borders. ""The continuation and sustainability of a ceasefire relies on the creation of a comprehensive monitoring mechanism in particular control of borders in order to stop the dispatch of fresh terrorists as well as weapons and financial resources for the terrorists"" he said.

Tags Syria Hama airstrikes civilian casualties Maardes Jund al-Aqsa Jaish al-Fatah At least 25 civilians have been killed by government airstrikes in Syrias central province of Hama as government forces responded to a major rebel offensive in the area. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] the deaths occurred during overnight raids on a road near the town of Latamina. Syrian state media claimed that government forces had killed 50 ""terrorists"" in ""concentrated strikes"" in the area. Hamas recent upsurge in violence follows the launch of a major offensive by the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups including Jaish al-Fatah and Jund al-Aqsa to push regime forces out of the central province.

The gains are predominantly to the north of Hama province including the towns of Suran and Halfaya. ""They are about 10 kilometres from the [Hama] airport"" said SOHRs director Rami Abdel Rahman. Hama city was briefly in rebel hands at the start of Syrias revolution but was subject to a siege by the regime who later recaptured the city.

1923102941,Deadly Aleppo convoy attack threatens aid distribution in Syria,"Date of publication 21 September 2016 The United Nations has suspended aid distribution in Syria after an attack on an aid convoy in Urum al-Kubra but has vowed to continue working in the war-torn country. The targeting of an aid convoy in Aleppo early this week has resulted in international condemnation forced the United Nations to suspend their aid operations inside Syria and threatened aid distribution within the war-torn country. On Monday evening a convoy of 31 lorries carrying supplies for 78000 people including vitamins and blankets books and pencils for children and medicine to treat burns and diabetes was targeted by purported airstrikes in the town of Urum al-Kubra a town in the western Aleppo Governorate northwestern Syria. 	 	 In the attack 18 of the 31 lorries were destroyed and 20 civilians were killed. The dead included Omar Barakat head of the local branch of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). Barakat is said to have died of his wounds as emergency services tried desperately to reach the area. On Tuesday SARC the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Crescent Societies released a joint statement expressing ""outrage"" at the ""horrific attack"". ""Were devastated by the deaths of so many people including one of our colleagues. He was a committed and brave member of our family of committed staff and volunteers working relentlessly to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people"" said SARC President Dr Abdulrahman Attar. Speaking to The New Arab Mona Kurdi a spokesperson for SARC noted that the attack on the convoy occurred in the vicinity of a SARC distribution centre. ""It was just a warehouse everyone knew this"" said Kurdi. Laila Kiki a media spokesperson for The Syria Campaign which networks with aid groups inside Syria including Syrian Civil Defence or ""White Helmets"" units expressed similar dismay.

A convoy of 31 lorries carrying supplies for 78000 people including vitamins and blankets books and pencils for children and medicine to treat burns and diabetes was targeted by purported airstrikes	 	 End to US-Russian brokered ceasefire? Humanitarian groups including Human Rights Watch have since called for investigations into the attack. The attack appeared to signal the end of a Russian-US brokered ceasefire that came into force in Syria on the evening of September 12. But on Tuesday morning US Secretary of State John Kerry speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during an interval from a bleak meeting of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) ministers in New York insisted the ceasefire was ""not dead."" Later in the day Reuters reported that preliminary conclusions reached by US officials based on their intelligence pointed to Russian responsibility. Videos recorded on the ground at the time show a dark still night sky interrupted by bright red-orange bursts of flame accompanied by loud reverberating bangs with panic stricken voices relaying that aid cars have been hit. One media activist who spoke to BBC Arabic and witnessed the attack said that the first strike against the convoy occurred at around 7 pm local time on Monday evening when a helicopter dropped a number of barrel bombs. Later attacks the media activist said saw rocket and machine gun fire from aircraft. 	 	Videos recorded on the ground at the time show a dark still night sky interrupted by bright red-orange bursts of flame accompanied by loud reverberating bangs with panic stricken voices relaying that aid cars have been hit	 	 Russia deny responsibility However Russia has denied any responsibility. On Tuesday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that videos recorded at the scene showed no evidence of ""munitions hitting the convoy"" and instead attributed the destruction to ""a fire"". UN officials say that the convoy travelling to Urum al-Kubra had received necessary clearances and all parties had been notified of its journey and agenda. The organisations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) revealed in a statement on Tuesday that it first became aware the aid convoy had come under attack at 8.15 pm local time. A matter of hours earlier Syrian state media published an article stating that the Syrian Army had declared the ceasefire over citing 300 violations committed by rebel groups who had used the agreement a pretext to ""mobilise and re-assemble."" In the immediate aftermath of the attack confusion spread over whether the aid convoy hit in Urum al-Kubra had travelled to Aleppo from the Turkish border. Last week a convoy of 20 aid trucks carrying enough supplies to feed 185000 people in rebel-held east Aleppo for a month remained stuck awaiting necessary clearances. However an informed source within the UN told The New Arab that the targeted convoy had travelled to Urum al-Kubra from a UN hub in government-controlled west Aleppo. ""The convoy waiting at Bab al-Hawa never left"" said the UN source. 	 	 Warplanes return to Aleppo skies On Tuesday in the aftermath of the attack the familiar yet deadly sight of government helicopters and warplanes patrolling the skies after a week of relative calm returned to rebel-held east Aleppo. Civilian casualties from government bombardment were reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in areas including the al-Sekkari and al-Merja neighbourhoods and Janah al-Salama in the countryside east of Aleppo. ""It was calmer last week but today there was shelling at seven in the morning and it continued during the day"" said Mohamad Abu Rajab a nurse based in a hospital in eastern Aleppo supported by the Syrian American Medical Association. ""We lack equipment like CT scans and other things to treat the injured and there is nowhere for people here to go. ""There is no way out"" continued Abu Rajab explaining that he often worked 20 hour shifts rarely left the hospital and was forced to work in a basement to avoid the devastating effects of aerial munitions routinely dropped on the city. ""The people civilians they want to live in peace"" said Abu Rajab noting that supplies of fuel for stoves and basic food were running low in the city leading prices to skyrocket. 	 	We lack equipment like CT scans and other things to treat the injured and there is nowhere for people here to go - Mohamad Abu Rajab medic in opposition-held east Aleppo	 	 Aid distribution threatened On Tuesday Kevin Kennedy OCHAs regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria said that the attacks in Urum al-Kubra were inexcusable showed a ""blatant disregard for the lives of humanitarian workers"" and constituted a violation of ""all basic principles of law and humanity."" The attacks have cast serious questions about how vital aid will be distributed to communities within Syria such as the estimated 300000 strong community of rebel-held east Aleppo. Despite temporarily suspending operations in Syria OCHA has reaffirmed its commitment to aid distribution within Syria stating ""United Nations humanitarian agencies are needed now more than ever and will stay and deliver for the people of Syria regardless of where they are in the country."" Laila Kiki of The Syria Campaign noted with concern that that the humanitarian situation in rebel-held east Aleppo would only worsen if aid went undelivered. ""This attack seems like a new low.

1923102942,Four medics killed in strike on clinic near Aleppo,"Date of publication 21 September 2016 Four staff of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations were killed when an airstrike hit a clinic in a village near Syrias second city Aleppo. Tags Syria Aleppo humanitarian aid airstrikes Four medics were killed and a nurse critically wounded when an airstrike hit a clinic in a village near Syrias second city Aleppo late Tuesday just days after dozens of aid workers were killed. The four staff of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations were in two ambulances that had been called to the clinic to take some patients for more specialised treatment the group said. The clinic in the village of Khan Tuman was completely levelled and more dead were feared to be buried under the rubble the group added. The attack comes a day after all aid convoys to Syria were temporarily suspended after a deadly airstrike on Monday killed 12 aid workers and drivers and destroyed at least 18 trucks carrying aid to Aleppo. Its ""a very very dark day... for humanitarians across the world"" Jens Laerke spokesman for the UN humanitarian aid agency OCHA said. An infuriated United Nations warned Monday nights attack could amount to a war crime. In a statement late on Tuesday the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed that Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted the convoy. But Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire.

1923102943,Syrian Civil Defence US Russia regime attacked aid convoy,"Date of publication 21 September 2016 Russian and regime warplanes confirmed by Civil DefenceUS officials as behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians. Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the ""double-tap"" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. ""All the evidence we have points to that conclusion"" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. ""All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. ""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing"" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire.

1923102944,Syrian regime repels rebel offensive near Aleppo killing 40,"Date of publication 20 September 2016 Syrian regime forces backed by Russian air support repel a rebel offensive on the northern fringes of Syrias Aleppo on Tuesday killing 40 attackers Russias defence ministry said. Tags Syria Aleppo airstrike truce Russia rebels Handarat Mogambo aid convoy Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes pounded multiple battlefronts in Syria into the early hours of Tuesday repelling a rebel-led offensive on northern Aleppo Russian sources reported. At least 40 people were killed in the strikes RIA news agency quoted Russias Defence Ministry as saying. Air raids and artillery fire hit rebel-held districts until approximately 200 am [2300 GMT Monday] after the Syrian army declared a fraught week-long ceasefire over. Fire resumed in the early hours of Tuesday as loud booms were heard intermittently across the city. At least 39 civilians were killed in overnight bombardment of Aleppo and the surrounding province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said and fresh clashes had erupted on the southern edges of the city. Those killed overnight included 12 people mostly humanitarian workers who died on a raid on a joint United Nations Red Cross and Red Crescent convoy delivering assistance to the town of Orum al-Kubra in Aleppo province In the government-held west of the city an AFP correspondent reported the sound of shelling in the Mogambo district. Meanwhile the rebel-held Handarat district just a few miles north of Aleppo also came under fire The New Arab correspondent reported. Residents spent the night huddled together in their apartments sharing news about the collapsing truce by messenger. Aleppo like other major front lines in Syria had been relatively calm for the first few days after the truce brokered by Moscow and Washington came into effect on September 12. Violence slowly escalated late last week culminating at the weekend in deadly airstrikes on Aleppo and a US-led raid that killed scores of Syrian soldiers fighting the Islamic State group in the east. Fighting also intensified in the rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus where the army announced a major military operation on Monday just hours before declaring the ceasefire over. Artillery fire also hit the rebel-held central town of Talbisseh activist Hassaan Abu Nuh said. In the northwestern province of Idlib activist Nayef Mustafa said that planes had circled over the town of Salqin which is held by Syrias former al-Qaeda affiliate in alliance with Islamist rebels. ""Its calm now but there was machinegun fire by military aircraft overnight"" Mustafa told AFP. ""The ceasefire has collapsed and people are getting ready to be hit by barrel bombs. This is our situation."" The US-Russia truce deal had been billed as the best chance to put an end to more than five years of conflict in which more than 300000 people have been killed. The army declared an end to its ceasefire on Monday evening. Hours later a convoy delivering aid to besieged civilians in Aleppo province was hit by an airstrike which killed 12 Red Crescent volunteers and drivers and destroyed at least 18 trucks.

Tags Syria Aleppo al-Nusra Front al-Maleh Russia Rebels Bashar al-Assad At least 70 Syrian regime and rebel fighters have been killed in the past 24 hours of fighting following a failed pro-government assault in northern Aleppo province a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime and 39 rebel fighters have been killed in battles around al-Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Fighters from the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda al-Nusra Front were also killed said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has been attempting to seize al-Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the province and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian war planes have been battling for control of al-Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. 	 	[Click to enlarge] The pro-regime website al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of al-Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by the al-Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The Observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by al-Nusra and its allies while the city - the countrys pre-war commercial capital - has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the Observatory reported on Thursday. The conflict in Syria which has lasted five years has killed more than 280000 people.

Tags Syria air strike SOHR ISIS Deir az-Zour al-Asharah civilians Ramadan. Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province. ""The market was overcrowded on Monday because people were shopping for Ramadan"" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded. Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday. IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name. The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there. Regime air raids killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir az-Zour city on Friday.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others - including a child - died in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily ""There are only civilians here there are no rebels!"" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012.

1923102962,Airstrikes kill 28 civilians in Syria safe zone monitor,Date of publication 30 September 2017 Four children are among the 28 dead in overnight airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said. State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armys losses.

The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 percent of the city from IS. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does ""everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure."" He said ""rigorous standards"" were applied to coalition targeting and ""extraordinary efforts"" taken to avoid civilian deaths. ""The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well"" he added in an email to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher.

""At least 11 people were killed including two children"" he said. ""There are around 20 wounded and the toll of victims could rise."" Much of Idlib province including Maaret al-Numan is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) a group led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate. Idlib is one of four so-called ""de-escalation"" zones under a deal brokered by Moscow Ankara and Tehran in May. HTS is not party to the de-escalation agreement although Idlib province should come under the safe zone plan.

Tags Syria Rebels De-escalation Damascus Four civilians were killed in the Syrian capital on Sunday after rebel shelling on the central district of Old Damascus a Britain-based monitor and a medical source said. Seven others were wounded in the attack according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. A doctor receiving the casualties confirmed the death toll and said most of the injured were ""gravely wounded by shrapnel"". The Observatory said shelling on Sunday hit several areas of the capital including the eastern district of Tabbaleh. Meanwhile state news agency SANA said artillery fire killed two people and wounded nine others in the Bab Sharqi area of Old Damascus. It followed a drop in violence in Damascus since the implementation in July of a de-escalation zone in a rebel-held area to its east. Eastern Ghouta is one of four such zones agreed at May peace talks on the Syrian conflict sponsored by rebel backer Turkey and regime supporters Russia and Iran. SANA said four people were wounded on Saturday when two mortar rounds hit the Absasiyeen Square in the centre of the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

1923102973,Three White Helmets workers and six children killed in Syria air,"Date of publication 18 November 2017 Heavy Syrian regime bombing has killed three emergency workers from the White Helmets while six children were also killed in Damascus air raids. Tags Syria Eastern Ghouta Douma Syrian regime bombing Siege White Helmets Three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets - have been killed in bombing in a besieged Damascus suburb the group said on Friday. The men were killed as they provided aid to civilians injured in bombing in Syrias Eastern Ghouta region when the air strike took place. Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. ""The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers"" the group said in a statement. ""Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured."" Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a ""guided missile"" which follows routine ""double tap"" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks.

1923102974,Civilians killed in relentless regime bombing of besieged Damascus,"Date of publication 20 November 2017 Syrian regime forces have continued bombardment of a besieged Damascus suburb killing more civilians on the sixth consecutive day of heavy bombing - and prompting a UN warning. Tags Syria Damascus Eastern Ghouta Assad UN SOHR Intense Syrian regime bombardment on rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region has killed eight civilians and wounded 25. Six days of heavy bombing have killed dozens in the region where rebel groups and regime forces are locked in a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks. Government forces have escalated their bombardment of Eastern Ghouta an opposition stronghold outside Damascus since hardline rebel group Ahrar al-Sham attacked a military base in the area last week. Since Tuesday heavy artillery fire and air strikes on Eastern Ghouta have killed at least 66 civilians including 13 children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as well as three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets. At least 281 people have been wounded the Britain-based monitor said on Sunday. Rebel groups meanwhile have fired rockets into Damascus neighbourhoods killing at least 16 people since Thursday the Observatory said. The toll included two people killed by rocket fire on Sunday. Eastern Ghouta is supposed to be part of a ""de-escalation zone"" under a deal between Russia Iran and Turkey aimed at reducing the level of violence. President Bashar al-Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2013 making humanitarian conditions in the area where some 400000 people live extremely dire. On Sunday the UNs coordinator for humanitarian and development affairs in Syria Ali al-Zaatari called on ""all warring sides to avoid targeting civilians"". ""For days there have been daily reports about civilians being killed and others being severely wounded in addition to warehouses hospitals and schools being put out of service during the exchange of shellfire particularly in Damascus and Eastern Ghouta"" Zaatari said. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

Tags Syria Assad Russia Eastern Ghouta Douma airstrikes More than 19 civilians were killed in Eastern Ghouta on Sunday as the Syrian regime stepped up its campaign to retake the last major opposition stronghold near the capital Damascus. At least 123 civilians have been killed in the besieged suburb by airstrikes and shelling since the Syrian regime and Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A witness told Reuters that there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning with warplanes heavily bombing the towns of Mesraba Harasta and Eastern Ghouta killing at least 19 civilians. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week that the intensifying bombardments were forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by Syrian regime forces since 2013 and no food aid convoys have entered the town of Douma since wheat flour rations in August. Civilians are eating rubbish fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days because of the food shortage the UN World Food Programme said this week. Nearly 174500 people trapped in the town of Douma since September have been forced to adopt emergency ""coping strategies"" the UN said. WFP expects the situation to further deteriorate in the coming weeks when the current food stock is expected to be depleted completely eroding the current household coping strategies. In the east of Syria Russian air strikes on Sunday killed 34 civilians among them 15 children in a village held by Islamic State in Deir az-Zour province an activist group said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army.

1923102976,Russian strikes kill 53 civilians in Syrias Deir az-Zour,"Date of publication 27 November 2017 At least 53 civilians including 21 children died on Sunday when Russian air strikes hit residential buildings in a village held by Islamic State militants. Tags Russia Syria Assad Deir az-Zour Islamic State SOHR At least 53 civilians including 21 children perished early Sunday morning when Russian air strikes hit ""residential buildings"" in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah in Deir az-Zour province on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The monitor had initially given a death toll of 34 civilians but the number spiked after more bodies were recovered. ""The toll increased after removing the debris in a long day of rescue operation"" Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP adding the strikes hit ""residential buildings"". At least 18 people were also wounded in the air raids he added. Russia is a close ally of Syrias President Bashar al-Assad and in September 2015 began a military intervention in support of his government that has gradually helped Damascus regain territory. Syrias Deir az-Zour is one of the last places IS jihadists hold territory in the country after being driven from their major strongholds including their one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqqa city. The oil-rich eastern province that borders Iraq was once almost completely under IS control but the jihadists now hold just nine percent of Deir az-Zour according to the Observatory. They have faced two separate offensives there one led by the regime with Russian backing and the other by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. Russia in drivers seat The latest strikes come as the United Nations tries to revitalise its flagging efforts to end a six-year civil war that has left Syria devastated and huge swathes of its population refugees. Syrias Deir az-Zour [click to enlarge] On Tuesday the eighth round of UN-brokered talks will kick off. They have achieved little so far but may be bolstered by the oppositions decision to bring a unified delegation to Geneva for the first time. For progress to happen rival sides will need to overcome the hurdle that has derailed past discussions the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He retains Moscows support but is loathed by much of Syrias rebel opposition who want him gone. Backed by Russias decisive military support Assads government has regained control of 55 percent of the country including major cities Damascus Aleppo Homs and Hama and around two-thirds of the population lives in regime-held areas. The rest is carved up between rebel factions jihadists and Kurdish forces. Some experts believe that Russia has clearly put itself in the drivers seat in recent months especially as US President Donald Trumps administration has pulled back from Syrian diplomatic front. Russia fellow regime ally Iran and rebel-backer Turkey have hosted negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana that led to the creation of four ""de-escalation zones"" which produced a drop in violence though deadly air strikes and battles continue in some areas. And this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a ""congress"" of Syrian regime and opposition figures a move backed by Ankara and Tehran. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army.

1923848121,10 dead after strikes on rebel-held hospitals in Syria,"10 dead after strikes on rebel-held hospitals in Syria Air strikes on two hospitals in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Thursday left 10 people dead including two babies in incubators a monitor said. They were among 19 people killed as a result of strikes across rebel-held Idlib province on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. An AFP correspondent in the village of Deir Sharqi where one of the hospitals was hit saw extensive damage and wards buried in rubble. It was the third time in less than a week that medical facilities in the province controlled by rebels and Islamist militant groups had been hit in air strikes. ""Apparently Russian aircraft... carried out four successive raids at dawn on a hospital on the outskirts"" of Deir Sharqi it said. ""Six civilians in the emergency department were killed including two babies in incubators after the destruction of the facilitys oxygen generator"" which was keeping them alive Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. The AFP correspondent saw at least one destroyed incubator rooms and corridors filled with rubble and dusty or damaged beds and equipment. In one room a wall had collapsed on a medicine shelf and in another medical supplies were strewn across the room. Later in the day four medical staff from a dispensary in Maarzita in southern Idlib province were also killed in what were likely Russian strikes the Observatory said. A further nine people including five children were killed in strikes on various other areas of Idlib province on Thursday it said. On Saturday an air raid on another hospital in Idlib had wounded five people the Observatory said but it could not say whether the raid was Syrian or Russian. Another hospital was hit Tuesday in northwestern Idlib putting it out of service Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used.

1923848126,Dozens of children dead in Syria evacuees bombing,"Dozens of children dead in Syria evacuees bombing Nearly 70 children were among those killed when a suicide car bombing tore through buses carrying evacuees from besieged government-held towns in Syria a monitor said on Sunday. Saturdays blast hit a convoy carrying residents from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya as they waited at a transit point in rebel-held Rashidin west of Aleppo. At least 68 children were among the 126 people killed in the attack the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said updating a previous toll of 112 dead. At least 109 of the dead were evacuees the Britain-based monitoring group said while the rest were aid workers and rebels guarding the convoy. The evacuations were taking place under a deal between Syrias regime and rebels that is also seeing residents and rebels transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. The agreement is the latest in a string of evacuation deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence after more than six years of civil war. Rebels say they amount to forced relocations after years of bombardment and crippling sieges. Body parts and the belongings of evacuees - including clothes dishes and even televisions - were still strewn at the scene of the attack on Sunday an AFP correspondent said. The shattered buses were nearby as was the shell of a pick-up truck - with little left but its engine block - that was apparently used to carry out the bombing. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing though the key Ahrar al-Sham rebel group denied any involvement. The government blamed ""terrorists"" - a catch-all term for its opponents. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria to monitor the conflict said hundreds of people were also wounded in the blast. It said a petrol station at the transit point was caught up in the explosion adding to the number of victims. The Syrian Red Crescent said three of its workers were among the wounded. Maysa al-Aswad a 30-year-old evacuee from Kafraya said she was sitting on one of the buses with her six-month-old son Hadi and 10-year-old daughter Narjis when the blast shook the parked convoy. ""Hadi was on my lap and Narjis on a chair next to me. When the explosion happened I hugged them both and we fell to the floor"" she told AFP by telephone from near Aleppo. ""I didnt know what was happening all I could hear was people crying and shouting"" she said. ""All I can think about is how we survived all the death during the last few years and then could have died just after we finally escaped."" More than 5000 people left Fuaa and Kafraya and about 2200 left Madaya and Zabadani on Friday the latest in a series of evacuations from the four towns under the agreement. The evacuation process resumed after the bombing the Observatory said with the residents of Fuaa and Kafraya eventually arriving in Aleppo Syrias second city which the government gained full control of last year. Wounded survivors including many children were taken for treatment at an Aleppo hospital. UN aid chief Stephen OBrien condemned the bombing saying in a statement ""The perpetrators of such a monstrous and cowardly attack displayed a shameless disregard for human life."" Pope Francis on Sunday also urged an end to the war in Syria as he presided over the traditional Easter mass in Rome. The pontiff said he hoped that Jesus Christs sacrifice might help bring ""comfort and relief to the civil population in Syria prey to a war that continues to sow horror and death"". The residents and rebels from Madaya and Zabadani arrived late Saturday in rebel-held territory in Idlib province where they were greeted with embraces and shots fired into the air. It was not immediately clear whether further evacuations were taking place on Sunday.

1923848127,Death toll from Aleppo bus convoy bomb attack at least 126 Observatory,"Death toll from Aleppo bus convoy bomb attack at least 126 Observatory The death toll from a bomb attack on a crowded bus convoy outside Aleppo has reached at least 126 in the deadliest such incident in Syria in almost a year the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a ""treacherous terrorist attack"". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as ""ignoble"" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the ""beloved and martyred Syria"". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place.

1923848128,Bombing of Syrian bus convoy kills wounds dozens outside Aleppo,"Bombing of Syrian bus convoy kills wounds dozens outside Aleppo A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to cross into government-held Aleppo in Syria on Saturday killing and wounding dozens of people evacuated from two Shia villages the day before in a deal between warring sides. The agreement had stalled leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the citys outskirts before the explosion occurred. Pro-Damascus media outlets said a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb and killed at least 22 people. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 24. Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and vehicles in flames. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shia villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. They had left under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya a government-besieged town near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring ""international organizations"" to intervene so the situation did not escalate. The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition who say they amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shia regional allies. It was unclear who carried out Saturdays bombing attack. The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. FORCED DISPLACEMENT A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shia villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. ""After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua"" Mehdi Tahhan said. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave"" he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assads Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shia fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.",ahram,4/15/2017,aleppo,1,bomb syrian bu convoy kill wound dozen outsid aleppo bomb blast hit bu convoy wait cross governmentheld aleppo syria saturday kill wound dozen peopl evacu two shia villag day deal war side agreement stall leav thousand peopl governmentbesieg rebelbesieg area strand two transit point citi outskirt explos occur prodamascu media outlet said suicid attack deton car bomb kill least 22 peopl britishbas syrian observatori human right said death toll least 24 footag state tv show bodi lie next char buse window blown vehicl flame blast hit buse rashidin area aleppo outskirt vehicl wait sinc friday cross rebelheld territori governmentcontrol citi convoy carri resid progovern fighter rebelbesieg shia villag alfoua kefraya nearbi idlib provinc left deal exchang hundr sunni insurg famili grant safe passag madaya governmentbesieg town near damascu delay agreement left evacu stuck transit point aleppo outskirt sinc late friday resid alfoua kefraya wait rashidin area rebel resid madaya near damascu wait governmentheld ramousah bu garag mile away transport opposit stronghold idlib provinc peopl wait ramousah garag heard blast said fear reveng attack progovern forc circul statement social media implor intern organ interven situat escal evacu deal one sever recent month seen presid bashar alassad govern take back control area long besieg forc alli deal unpopular syrian opposit say amount forc displac assad oppon syria main urban center west countri also caus demograph chang displac usual sunni muslim like opposit assad minor alawit sect support shia region alli unclear carri saturday bomb attack exact reason delay complet evacu deal also unclear observatori said delay caus fact rebel zabadani anoth town near damascu includ deal yet grant safe passag forc displac proopposit activist said insurg blame delay partli fact smaller number progovern fighter left shia villag agre earlier saturday transit point buse alfoua kefraya wait one resid said yet sure would live aleppo ill see rest group prepar hous land belong alfoua mehdi tahhan said madaya resid speak bu garag insid aleppo said peopl wait sinc late friday allow leav there drink water food bu garag small there much space move around ahm 24 said sad angri happen said mani peopl felt forc leav said choic end besieg insid small area madaya evacu deal recent month includ area aleppo district citi hom syria popul mostli sunni assad alawit religi minor often consid offshoot shia islam back militarili russia shia fighter iran lebanes hezbollah group syria sixyearold conflict assad militari advantag rebel west thank russia intervent 2015 although insurg still fight back made gain area

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear if the strike on the rebel-held town in northwest Syrias Idlib province was carried out by Syrian planes or those of government ally Russia. The death was the first in the town since a suspected chemical weapons attack on Tuesday that killed 87 civilians including 31 children and left hundreds suffering symptoms including convulsions vomiting and foaming at the mouth. Much of the international community pointed the finger at President Bashar al-Assads government for the attack though it denied any responsibility. US President Donald Trump ordered the first direct US military action against Assads government in response to the attack launching missiles against an air base in central Syria. Khan Sheikhun has been hit several times since the Tuesday attack including in a strike in the hours afterwards on a hospital treating victims. Idlib province is largely held by an alliance of rebels including a former Al-Qaeda affiliate and is regularly targeted in Syrian and Russian air strikes. The US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State (IS) militant group has also carried out rare strikes in the province.

Six children were among the dead in Eastern Ghouta the largest rebel bastion near Damascus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""It was a series of air strikes throughout the day and the death toll may still rise"" the Britain-based group added. He said civilians had died in Jisreen Kafr Batna and the largest of the towns in Eastern Ghouta Douma. An AFP photographer in Douma saw half a dozen wounded children sitting on the floor of a makeshift clinic caked in dust and blood as they awaited treatment. But most of the victims - 14 - died in air strikes on an area between the opposition-held towns of Hammuriyah and Saqba. Another AFP photographer in Saqba saw residents scrambling over rubble and through clouds of dust tossing debris aside as they searched for signs of life. One man sat atop a small mountain of cinderblocks clothes and furniture with his head in his hands. The Observatory said Tuesdays bombardment brought to 49 the number killed in Eastern Ghouta in two days of attacks. ""There has been fierce artillery shelling and air strikes since yesterday and 165 people total have been wounded"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local ""reconciliation deals"" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. Hundreds of people were killed in Eastern Ghouta in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops in August 2013. On Tuesday at least 58 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun according to the Observatory. Dozens more suffered respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the monitor and doctors at the scene said.

1923848146,Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory,"Tuesday 4 Apr 2017 Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory Reuters A suspected gas attack believed to be by Syrian government jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children under the age of eight in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday a war monitor and medical workers in the rebel-held area said. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war monitoring group. ""This morning at 630 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine"" said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. ""Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people"" he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military Denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army ""has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place"" the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population Ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. U.S. air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where jihadists have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.",ahram,4/4/2017,idlib,0,tuesday 4 apr 2017 suspect ga attack syria rebelheld idlib kill least 58 observatori reuter suspect ga attack believ syrian govern jet kill least 58 peopl includ 11 children age eight northwestern provinc idlib tuesday war monitor medic worker rebelheld area said syrian militari sourc strongli deni armi use weapon attack caus mani peopl choke faint foam come mouth syrian observatori human right said cite medic sourc describ sign ga attack air strike town khan sheikhoun south rebelheld idlib also wound 60 peopl said observatori britishbas war monitor group morn 630 warplan target khan sheikhoun gase believ sarin chlorin said mounzer khalil head idlib health author ad attack kill 50 peopl wound 300 hospit idlib provinc overflow wound peopl told news confer idlib warplan later struck near medic point victim attack treat observatori said civil defenc worker said civil defenc also known white helmet rescu servic oper opposit area syria said jet struck one centr area nearbi medic point would mark deadliest chemic attack syria sinc sarin ga kill hundr civilian ghouta near damascu august 2013 western state said syrian govern respons attack damascu blame rebel militari deni syrian militari sourc tuesday deni alleg govern forc use chemic weapon dismiss account rebel propaganda armi use past futur first place sourc said joint inquiri unit nation global chemic weapon watchdog previous accus govern forc toxic ga attack franc call emerg un secur council meet tuesday suspect attack reuter photograph show peopl breath oxygen mask wear protect suit other carri bodi dead children corps wrap blanket line ground activist northern syria circul pictur social media show purport victim foam around mouth rescu worker hose almost nake children squirm floor town street becom empti wit said conflict pit presid bashar alassad govern help russia iranianback militia wide array rebel group includ support turkey unit state gulf monarchi russian defenc ministri said tuesday russian plane carri air strike idlib syrian russian air strike batter part idlib despit ceasefir turkey russia broker decemb accord observatori turkish presid tayyip erdogan russian presid vladimir putin discuss suspect attack turkish presidenti sourc said said two leader also emphasis import maintain ceasefir popul balloon idlib provinc contain largest popul area control antiassad rebel nationalist free syrian armi group islamist faction includ former al qaedalink nusra front idlib popul balloon thousand fighter civilian shuttl aleppo citi area around damascu govern retaken recent month us air strike sinc januari also hit sever area rural provinc jihadist power presenc unit nation organis prohibit chemic weapon investig whether damascu adher commit 2013 agreement avert threat usl militari intervent report octob last year inquiri said govern forc use chemic weapon least three time 20142015 islam state use mustard ga 2015 follow 2013 ghouta attack syrian govern join intern chemic weapon convent usrussian deal govern deni forc behind ghouta attack also agre hand declar stockpil 1300 tonn toxic weaponri dismantl chemic weapon program intern supervis damascu repeatedli deni use weapon sixyear war kill hundr thousand creat world worst refuge crisi

1923848149,Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day,"Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. ""This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces"" Captain Jeff Davis said. ""We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened."" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"".

1923848150,More than 30 Syrian rebels killed in IS group suicide blast,"More than 30 Syrian rebels killed in IS group suicide blast The Islamic State militants group (IS) on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed more than 30 Syrian rebel fighters in a blast near the Turkish border. IS in a statement published on Twitter and the messaging service Telegram said a suicide bomber detonated an explosive belt among rebels ""getting ready to fight the Islamic State"". The blast on Sunday night struck the Atme border crossing between Turkey and the northern Syrian province of Idlib according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitoring group said the anti-regime fighters were travelling by bus to Turkey then back into Syria towards the rebel bastion of Azaz in Aleppo province. The attack killed 32 rebels as they were entering Turkey the Britain-based Observatory said updating an earlier toll on Sunday evening of 15. Its head Rami Abdel Rahman said the toll could rise further as other fighters remained critically wounded. ISs statement said the attack left ""nearly 50"" rebels dead charging they took orders from the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria. IS has tried to advance on rebel territory in Aleppo province - particularly the towns of Azaz and nearby Marea - for several months. A major militant offensive in May saw IS encircle Marea but rebels pushed back the assault the following month after receiving ammunition from the coalition.

1923848151,Warplanes pound Syrias Idlib as battles rage in Aleppo,"Sunday 14 Aug 2016 Warplanes pound Syrias Idlib as battles rage in Aleppo AP Syrias rebel-held northwestern Idlib province came under heavy bombardment Sunday activists reported as rebels and pro-government forces battled for control of the nearby city of Aleppo. Much of the fighting has been marked by indiscriminate shelling missile attacks and aerial bombardment killing scores of civilians across Idlib and Aleppo. The rebels do not have an air force. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since rebels launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory which monitors both sides of the conflict and gathers information from a network of activists inside Syria. The toll includes 126 people killed by rebel shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo once Syrias largest city and commercial capital is now the focal point of the civil war and the only major city where the opposition to President Bashar Assad still has a foothold. The rebel campaign spearheaded by ultraconservative factions including the al-Qaida-linked Jaish Fatah al-Sham formerly known as the Nusra Front has drawn manpower from Idlib some 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the west. A spokesman for the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham faction confirmed that the rebels were drawing recruits from Idlib. ""The battle for Aleppo concerns all of Syria"" said Abu Khaled who gave only his nom de guerre. At least 97 rebel fighters from Idlib have died in combat in Aleppo since July 31 according to Abdurrahman. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. On Sunday evening rebels opened a new front sending a truck bomb into the western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. To the east a Kurdish-led force known as the Syria Democratic Forces drove the Islamic State group out of the strategic town of Manbij on Saturday and announced a new campaign against al-Bab a nearby town held by the extremists. The U.S. has provided the SDF with air cover and American special forces are advising them on the ground. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on IS near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Elsewhere in Syria rebels and government forces battled around a major power plant in the central Hama province. State media reported that rebels inflicted heavy damage to the Zaara generating station while an opposition media activist in the nearby town of Aqrab said the power plant was not targeted. Obeida al-Hamawi of the activist-run Hama Media Center said government forces had launched an assault from positions near the plant to retake the village of Zaara captured by rebels earlier this year. He said electricity was still being supplied to the area. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the area. In the south rockets set two apartment blocks on fire in a besieged opposition-held suburb of Damascus. The local council in Daraya accused the government of using incendiary weapons and posted videos showing volunteers transporting water tanks on tractors to help firefighters battle the blaze. The Observatory also reported a government rocket attack on the suburb. Following an international appeal the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated a 10-year-old girl from the besieged Damascus suburb of Madaya to receive urgent care after activists say she was shot by a pro-government sniper on Aug. 2. Syrian state media said ""terrorists"" shot Ghinwa Qweider and then prevented her evacuation. Amnesty International said the government held up the request for nearly two weeks.",ahram,8/14/2016,idlib,0,sunday 14 aug 2016 warplan pound syria idlib battl rage aleppo ap syria rebelheld northwestern idlib provinc came heavi bombard sunday activist report rebel progovern forc battl control nearbi citi aleppo much fight mark indiscrimin shell missil attack aerial bombard kill score civilian across idlib aleppo rebel air forc britainbas syrian observatori human right report 26 airstrik sunday across idlib one last remain opposit bastion observatori head rami abdurrahman said russian govern airstrik provinc intensifi sinc rebel launch campaign idlib break govern sieg aleppo opposit district juli 31 strike kill 122 civilian said anoth 327 civilian includ 126 children kill fight aleppo provinc accord observatori monitor side conflict gather inform network activist insid syria toll includ 126 peopl kill rebel shell governmentheld part aleppo citi ten thousand syrian displac aleppo found refug idlib home prewar popul 15 million local coordin committe activist network said russian jet struck town jisr alshaghour binnish observatori report strike provinci capit idlib unclear activist identifi plane aleppo syria largest citi commerci capit focal point civil war major citi opposit presid bashar assad still foothold rebel campaign spearhead ultraconserv faction includ alqaidalink jaish fatah alsham formerli known nusra front drawn manpow idlib 30 kilomet 19 mile west spokesman ultraconserv ahrar alsham faction confirm rebel draw recruit idlib battl aleppo concern syria said abu khale gave nom de guerr least 97 rebel fighter idlib die combat aleppo sinc juli 31 accord abdurrahman aleppo still home 2 million peopl live governmentcontrol western district sunday even rebel open new front send truck bomb western zahraa neighborhood accord twitter account islam front one faction fight citi observatori report fight citi western southern district east kurdishl forc known syria democrat forc drove islam state group strateg town manbij saturday announc new campaign albab nearbi town held extremist us provid sdf air cover american special forc advis ground moscow wage air campaign support govern forc nearli year russia militari said six longrang tu22m3 bomber took russian territori carri strike sunday near eastern syrian citi deir elzour made mention strike idlib elsewher syria rebel govern forc battl around major power plant central hama provinc state media report rebel inflict heavi damag zaara gener station opposit media activist nearbi town aqrab said power plant target obeida alhamawi activistrun hama media center said govern forc launch assault posit near plant retak villag zaara captur rebel earlier year said electr still suppli area observatori report heavi clash area south rocket set two apart block fire besieg oppositionheld suburb damascu local council daraya accus govern use incendiari weapon post video show volunt transport water tank tractor help firefight battl blaze observatori also report govern rocket attack suburb follow intern appeal syrian arab red crescent evacu 10yearold girl besieg damascu suburb madaya receiv urgent care activist say shot progovern sniper aug 2 syrian state media said terrorist shot ghinwa qweider prevent evacu amnesti intern said govern held request nearli two week
1923848153,Rebel fire in Syrias Aleppo kills 14 State media,"Wednesday 10 Aug 2016 Rebel fire in Syrias Aleppo kills 14 State media AFP A barrage of rocket fire from Syrian rebels killed at least 14 people and left dozens wounded Wednesday in government-held neighbourhoods of divided Aleppo city state media said. Fighting struck the southern edges of the battered city Wednesday night as opposition fighters and regime forces gear up for a major protracted battle that could mark a turning point in the five-year war. Syrian state news agency SANA said rebel fire on the regime-controlled district of Hamdaniyeh on Wednesday killed 13 people and wounded 25 others. Rocket attacks on another government-held neighbourhood killed one person and wounded 12 others earlier in the day. SANA said Russian and government planes targeted ""terrorist"" positions in the citys south as an AFP journalist in Aleppo said intense air strikes and artillery fire could be heard. But it was unclear if the major push for control of the city had begun. An estimated 1.2 million people live in zones controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo with about 250000 people in the rebel-held eastern districts. Residents across the city have been living in fear of competing sieges since fighting surged in late June over rival access routes into Aleppo. Russias military announced a three-hour daily halt of fighting starting on Thursday to allow humanitarian convoys to reach Aleppo but the UNs top aid official said it would not be enough.

The monitor said the raids targeted the town of Milis in Idlib province which borders Turkey and is controlled by a rebel alliance led by Al-Qaedas former Syrian branch. The Britain-based monitor said three children and two women were among the dead adding that the raids were carried out by either Russian or regime warplanes. The Idlib Media Center which publishes news on developments in the province said a hospital was hit in the raid by unidentified aircraft and that at least six people had been killed. The World Health Organisation said Syria was the most dangerous place for health care workers to operate last year with 135 attacks on health facilities and workers in 2015. In late July four makeshift hospitals and a local blood bank in Syrias battered Aleppo city were hit by air raids in a single day.

1923848168,US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor,"Tuesday 19 Jul 2016 US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor AFP Children were among at least 56 civilians killed in strikes by a US-led coalition early on Tuesday near a Syrian village held by the Islamic State (IS) group a monitor said. ""There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. ""If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be ""devastating"" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts. It said relief supplies had already been stockpiled in the city but ""further life-saving aid is needed urgently.""",ahram,7/19/2016,aleppo,1,tuesday 19 jul 2016 usl strike kill 56 civilian syria monitor afp children among least 56 civilian kill strike usl coalit earli tuesday near syrian villag held islam state group monitor said least 56 dead includ 11 children dozen wound includ critic condit said rami abdel rahman director britainbas syrian observatori human right monitor said civilian hit flee fight aleppo provinc villag altukhar appar mistaken group fighter observatori reli network sourc insid syria inform say determin plane carri raid accord type locat flight pattern munit involv ask incid coalit immedi comment said look report altukhar lie 14 kilometr nine mile north town manbij key group stronghold repeatedli target raid usl coalit monday observatori said 21 civilian kill coalit raid area 15 northern district manbij anoth six altukhar manbij sit iss main suppli rout syria neighbour turkey target usback offens kurdisharab allianc fighter sinc may 31 june syrian democrat forc allianc broke western district town advanc slow past month landmin plant jihadist ongo suicid attack near aleppo govern forc sought tighten sieg rebelheld district battleground second citi clash erupt around handarat larg desert palestinian refuge camp north citi govern forc seiz part remain suppli rout rebelheld eastern district effect sever outsid world captur castello road rais fear lengthi sieg east aleppo resid alreadi report food shortag rise price observatori said fierc clash underway around handarat camp less two kilometr bare mile northern outskirt citi regim take handarat abl complet asphyxi rebel east aleppo unabl launch counterattack retak castello road abdel rahman told afp analyst warn govern advanc around aleppo could devast rebel unit nation rais concern fate 200000 peopl still live rebelheld district said relief suppli alreadi stockpil citi lifesav aid need urgent

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town of Ariha in Idlib province were carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. The town is controlled by the Army of Conquest a rebel alliance of mainly Islamist groups including Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front that holds almost all of Idlib province. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province.

Hours of air strikes and shelling on Saturday struck Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said two medics were among the dead as well as women and children. One of those killed was Amjad al-Danaf head of Jayruds medical centre. Activists mourned him online and said he was killed in an air raid as he was trying to treat residents wounded in the attacks. The bombardment - the first on Jayrud in at least two years - began after Syrias armed forces said Islamist militants killed a government pilot when he was forced to eject from his plane on Friday. In a statement the military had pledged that the attack on its pilot ""will not go unpunished"". Early Sunday Abdel Rahman said prominent figures in Jayrud had reached an agreement with government officials that rebel fighters would leave the town and hand over the pilots body in exchange for a halt to the shelling. A Facebook page run by Jayrud activists that publishes news about the town said rebels began withdrawing from their bases around the town overnight. Anti-regime factions in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. A truce between the regime and local representatives had kept the town calm for over two years. Dozens of similar agreements have been brokered among the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias complex war. But a broader ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by the United States and Russia in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides.

The bombardment struck the town of Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus where the army says Islamist rebels killed the pilot after he was forced to eject on Friday. In its statement about the incident the military said the attack ""will not go unpunished."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturdays attack was the first bombardment of the town in at least two years. ""Prominent figures in Jayrud have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. He said at least 31 people were killed including two medics. It was not immediately clear how many of the rest were civilians. Activists in the town said the head of the local medical centre and several colleagues were killed. ""There have been at least 45 air strikes today. The towns medical centre was hit and its director Amjad al-Danaf was killed"" activist Abu Malek al-Jayrudi told AFP via the Internet. He said the town is home to some 60000 people and that the bombardment had not stopped since early Saturday. Rebel groups in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Jaish al-Islam spokesman Islam Alloush said on Friday that Al-Nusra Front had executed the air force pilot. Several government aircraft have been shot down by rebels or crashed because of technical faults since the civil war erupted five years ago. According to the Observatory three Syrian officers were killed on Friday when their helicopter crashed in the south near territory held by the Islamic State jihadist group. Abdel Rahman said government forces had managed to recover the bodies of the victims of the crash the cause of which remained unclear. ""We dont know if it was a technical issue or not but the bodies are with the regime"" Abdel Rahman said. Dozens of local truces have been brokered between the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias increasingly complex civil war. But a nationwide ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by Moscow and Washington in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. US officials have accused Russia of not doing enough to rein in its ally President Bashar al-Assad.

Once Syrias commercial hub Aleppo is divided between rebel groups entrenched in the east and government troops in the western neighbourhoods. It has suffered devastating damage as each side tries to dislodge the other. Rights groups have criticised both sides for indiscriminate attacks on civilians including with the regimes notorious barrel bombs. The Observatory said running water was restored Tuesday in Aleppo after a cut of more than three weeks apparently after an understanding between the regime and Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra which controls the pumping station in a rebel-held district had cut off supplies to pressure the government to restore electricity to areas under its control. The rebels turned the water back on after the regime caved in and restored electricity supplies according to the Observatory.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors violence in Syria said the air force conducted 60 strikes on the Eastern Ghouta district on Thursday and during the night. Twelve children and 11 fighters were among the dead it said. High death tolls from air force attacks are not rare but the Observatory said the focused barrage was a response to rocket attacks by Islam Army insurgents on Thursday which killed 10 people in Damascus. A message on Thursday on a Twitter account thought to belong to Islam Army chief Zahran Alloush said Thursdays rocket attack was a taste of what the Syrian military had done to Eastern Ghouta. Alloush described Damascus as a ""military zone"" and said his group would respond to any air force strikes.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least six children were among those killed in nearly 40 air raids on parts of Eastern Ghouta in Damascus province. The Britain-based group said at least 140 people were wounded adding that government forces had also fired surface-to-surface missiles at the area. The assault came after rebels fired at least 70 rockets and mortar rounds at the capital killing seven people including a policeman. The barrage left usually busy parts of the city deserted. ""Within minutes our busy street was empty"" said a resident of the Baramkeh neighbourhood adding that the headteacher of a local school had been forced to take her students to a shelter. The middle class district is home to several university buildings as well as the headquarters of state news agency SANA. In the city centre traffic was light and many people stayed home from work. Rebel group Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam) warned two days ago that it would launch a barrage of missiles at the capital in response to deadly air strikes on rebel-held Douma in Eastern Ghouta. Its leader Zahran Alloush said Damascus was now considered a ""military zone"" and a target for the rebels. The group has carried out such barrages before including on January 25 when it fired dozens of rockets after a similar warning killing six. In Douma the government air strikes brought chaos with an AFP photographer reporting civilians streaming into a makeshift clinic. Medics overwhelmed by the number of arrivals were forced to treat some on the floor. Among them was an infant his red and white striped sweater lifted up to allow medics to apply a defibrillator to his bloodied chest. Eastern Ghouta is a key rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus and has been under siege for nearly two years. Since mid-2012 the government has conducted frequent air raids on rebel-held areas. It is accused by human rights groups of indiscriminately killing both civilians and insurgents.

In Jassem in the southern province of Daraa 15 civilians were killed in four air strikes while 25 others were wounded said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes in response to a major rebel offensive that has been underway in southern Syria for months. ""As usual the regime is striking populated areas in order to make civilian supporters of opposition fighters turn against them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad have suffered a spate of defeats at the hands of his forces but they still have the upper hand in Daraa. ""Opposition fighters are making steady progress in Daraa province. The vast majority of the west of the province has completely fallen out of government control and that is where Jassem is located"" Abdel Rahman said. Rebel fighters in the area benefit from ""the fact that supply lines from Jordan are still open"" he added. The involvement of experienced fighters of Syrias Al-Qaeda affiliate the Al-Nusra Front has also helped the rebels to gain territory in Daraa. Elsewhere air strikes on Douma the besieged rebel-held town east of Damascus killed at least six civilians and wounded dozens more the Observatory said. An AFP photographer in Douma said the strikes hit residential areas and that most of the wounded were children. At Khan Sheikhun in the northwestern province of Idlib 11 people were killed including a former army officer who had defected from the loyalist army to join opposition forces said the Observatory. The regime first deployed warplanes in the Syrian war in July 2012. Now nearly four years into the conflict there are air strikes every day despite repeated warnings from the international community that such tactics fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. On a separate front Syrian Kurds fighting the Islamic State group made fresh advances near Kobane seizing a new string of villages a week after the flashpoint town was recaptured from the IS jihadists. ""The Kurds now control an area stretching across 14 kilometres (nine miles) southwards from Kobane 10 kilometres to the east and 10 to 12 kilometres to the west"" said Abdel Rahman. The Observatory director also said Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) backed by Syrian rebels killed 10 IS members in the past 24 hours.

The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. ""The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person"" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. ""Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province - where the town is located - has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile the Observatory said 10 children and 13 rebels were among 48 people executed by government forces in the northern village of Rityan earlier this week. The killings took place after troops entered the town Tuesday during an offensive aimed at cutting rebel supply lines to the Turkish border. Abdel Rahman said all the dead were from six families. ""There was no resistance except in one house where a rebel opened fire at troops before being executed along with his family."" The brief seizure of Rityan was part of an abortive army offensive this week to encircle the rebel-held east of Aleppo and relieve two besieged Shiite villages to its north. By Friday all but one of the villages taken by government forces had been recaptured by the rebels who include fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The heavy fighting claimed the lives of 129 loyalists and 116 rebels including an Al-Nusra commander according to an Observatory toll. While the ground offensive failed warplanes kept pounding rebel areas of Aleppo city and other parts of the country. On Saturday two women and two children were among eight people killed when a barrel bomb hit a building in an opposition-held area of Aleppo city once Syrias commercial capital. Six people were also reported killed in rebel shelling of regime-held areas of the city. The air force also killed at least 10 people in rebel areas east of Damascus Saturday the Observatory said. According to the group they were the latest of more than 7000 people killed across Syria since the UN Security Council passed a resolution last year ordering an end to sieges and indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas. The Observatory ""has documented the killing of 5812 civilians including 1733 children 969 women and 3110 men in barrel bombings and (other) air raids"" over the past year. Meanwhile rebel fire on regime-held areas killed 1102 people said the Observatory adding that 234 of them were children.

1923848202,35 IS jihadists killed in clashes with Syria Kurds Monitor,"35 IS jihadists killed in clashes with Syria Kurds Monitor AFP Sunday 15 Feb 2015 At least 35 Islamic State jihadists were killed on Sunday in clashes with Syrian Kurdish fighters around the flashpoint town of Kobane a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths came in three separate clashes around the town in Aleppo province of northern Syria. At least 22 of the jihadists were killed in fighting on the border between Aleppo and Raqa province where IS has its de-facto capital. That battle marked the first time in months that fighters from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) have expanded their attacks to the edge of Raqa province. Four YPG fighters were killed in those clashes with the Kurdish forces capturing the strategic Tal Baghdaq hilltop the Observatory said. The other jihadist deaths came in clashes to the west and south of Kobane the key border town that Kurdish forces recaptured on January 26. IS fighters began advancing on the town last September and at one point looked poised to overrun it cementing their grip on a long stretch of the Syria-Turkey border. But YPG ground forces backed by US-led air strikes were able to repel the IS fighters. Since the towns recapture YPG forces have been expanding their control from Kobane into the surrounding countryside where they have largely encountered little resistance from the jihadists. But the Observatory said the fighting around Tel Baghdaq on the Aleppo-Raqa border was some of the heaviest in the region since Kobane fell.

1923848211,At least 40 killed in Syrian weapons depot blast,"At least 40 killed in Syrian weapons depot blast Rocket attacks strike government-held districts in the central Syrian city of Homs Thursday killing 40 people and wounding 120 says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights AP Thursday 1 Aug 2013 Rocket attacks struck government-held districts in the central Syrian city of Homs on Thursday setting off successive explosions in a weapons depot that killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens an opposition group and residents said. The blasts sent a massive ball of fire into the sky causing widespread damage and panic among residents many of whom are supporters of President Bashar Assad. One resident said the explosions were so strong they cracked the walls of some buildings. Thick smoke and dust could be seen from a distance as explosions shook the ground. A video posted online by activists showed a huge ball of fire over Homs neighborhoods. The explosions in Homs reflected the see-saw nature of the conflict. It showed that despite significant advances by Assads military rebels could still strike back. An official at the governors office in Homs said about 10 rockets slammed into the neighborhood of Zahra and the nearby sports stadium sparking a large fire and causing several casualties. He said the explosions caused massive destruction and wounded at least 130 people. He didnt offer a number for those killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations. He did not give a casualty figure. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which closely monitors the fighting in Syria said 40 people were killed and 120 were wounded some critically when rockets struck an arms depot igniting the fire. A resident of Homs corroborated that account saying he heard blasts for more than an hour after the first explosion. He said they could be heard from the overwhelmingly pro-regime districts of Wadi Dahab and al-Walid where the regime is known to keep arms depots. ""Rockets were falling on the area ... when the arms depot began to explode but we dont know if the rockets triggered the blasts"" he said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. He said the explosions were so strong that ""they shook parts of the city."" They also shattered all windows in the area and cracked walls he added. He said he spoke with Syrian Arab Red Crescent paramedics who told him that at least 22 bodies were taken to hospitals. The explosions in Homs coincided with a rare trip by President Bashar Assad to a former rebel bastion near the capital Damascus to mark Army Day. Assads visit to Daraya is his first known public trip outside the capital his seat of power in more than a year. He visited the battered Baba Amr district in the central city of Homs after troops seized it from rebels in March 2012. It also is the latest sign of confidence from Assad whose troops have been on the offensive and scored significant gains against rebels in recent months. Assad pledged victory over troops fighting to topple him. More than 100000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Assad familys four-decade rule began in March 2011.

Afterwards angry parents and residents staged demonstrations calling for the resignation of senior security officials. Two officials were reassigned though Homss governor denied the move was related to the demonstrations.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths came in fighting in Hawijat Sakr on the Euphrates River. The clashes took place not far from Deir Ezzor military airport a key remaining post for the Syrian army in the oil-rich province. The Islamic State controls the majority of the province but parts of the provincial capital Deir Ezzor city are still in government hands along with the airport. Deir Ezzor has been a key target of strikes against IS by the US-led coalition fighting the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq. When the raids began IS withdrew from several of its positions and there have been few reports of active clashes involving the group in the province since. Elsewhere in Syria the Observatory reported at least 12 people killed in Syrian regime air strikes on the Ain Tarma area outside the capital Damascus. Among the dead were three children the Observatory said. The neighbourhood to the east of Damascus is under rebel control and is one of the areas regime forces have been battling to recapture from the opposition around the capital. Although government forces control Damascus rebels often fire missiles into the city from several strongholds on its outskirts.

Most of the 50 fighters killed in the attacks west of the second city Aleppo were foreigners and the civilians included three children and one woman the Britain-based monitoring group said. The strikes came in addition to separate raids carried out by a US-led coalition including Arab nations that hit the Islamic State jihadist group in north and east Syria.

The group it added has ""established a safe haven in Syria to develop external attacks construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit Westerners to conduct operations"". ""These strikes were undertaken only by US assets"" the statement added unlike the strikes against IS. The Khorasan Group is believed to refer to an initiative by Al-Qaedas central command in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to establish a group in Syria of some of its veteran militants to focus on attacks against the West. Its members cooperate with Al-Nusra Front Al-Qaedas Syria affiliate using the groups resources and bases according to experts.

On Sunday regime planes killed 31 jihadists and eight civilians in an unprecedented wave of aerial bombardment against the group in its Raqa bastion. The bombing continued on Monday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with at least 14 raids against jihadist positions. There was no immediate death toll in the renewed bombing. Three raids targeted the area around the town of Tabqa in western Raqa and four hit near the Tabqa military airport the only remaining regime-held position in the province. The other seven strikes hit sites inside Raqa city the provincial capital. The raids involved the use of precision weapons rather than the explosive-packed barrel bombs that the regime has deployed to deadly effect in Aleppo province and elsewhere. Barrel bombs have been criticised for being indiscriminate and killing civilians. The Syrian raids come as the United States carries out air strikes against the Islamic State just across the border in neighbouring Iraq. The US strikes are intended to limit the advance of IS militants who have seized large swathes of territory in both Iraq and Syria declaring an Islamic ""caliphate.""

Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed ""barrel bombs"" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared ""caliphate"" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias ""Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge"" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an ""existential threat"". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there ""living in appalling conditions"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. ""Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago"" it said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fate of around 200 other soldiers remained unknown as the IS assault forced the army to pull back late on Friday. The Division 17 base has fallen from army control but ""the jihadists have not moved into the site for fear of air strikes"" said the Britain-based groups director Rami Abdel Rahman. The IS lost at least 28 jihadist fighters he said. The Observatory said more than 50 troops were summarily executed 19 more were killed in a double suicide attack and at least 16 others had died in the IS assault launched early Thursday. ""Hundreds of troops surviving withdrew on Friday to safe places - either to nearby villages whose residents oppose IS or to nearby Brigade 93 - but the fate of some 200 remains unknown"" said Abdel Rahman.

The strikes also destroyed 14 of IS military vehicles the Observatory added. IS militants are firmly in control of Raqa their stronghold and have secured large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq. While some in the Syrian opposition initially welcomed IS - formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) - among their ranks viewing it as a potential ally its abuses and quest for control turned the rebels against them. Rebels have been fighting IS since January. The Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad for its part has escalated its attacks against IS positions since the group spearheaded a Sunni militant offensive in neighbouring Iraq. ""From 10 June (when Mosul fell from Iraqi government control) to date the Syrian air force really stepped up its raids against IS positions and there have been strikes every day since then"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.

Jihadist rebels blamed Russian warplanes of carrying out Mondays attack and said they would fight back against Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces and his Russian and Iranian backers in the six-year-old conflict. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three air strikes hit the market in Atareb west of Aleppo and killed at least 61 people. Atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under an agreement between Turkey Russia and Iran to reduce the bloodshed. But despite the diplomatic efforts fighting continues in many areas including Aleppo Idlib Raqqa Deir al-Zor and Hama. ""(The zones) did de-escalate fighting"" UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told Reuters. But lately ""there has been increased fighting also."" The zones were set up under the Astana process a series of talks in the capital of Kazakhstan between Russia and Iran and the rebels supporter Turkey. They agreed in September to deploy observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in Syrias Idlib province which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. Following the air strikes the Tahrir al-Sham jihadist alliance denounced the ceasefire talks and pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear whether the strikes on rebel-held Atareb had been carried out by Syrian warplanes or those of Damascuss ally Russia. The monitor said three strikes hit the towns market adding that the overall toll was expected to rise because dozens of people had been wounded or were still missing after the attack. A photographer contributing to AFP saw massive destruction at the scene with rubble from damaged buildings covering the street and panicked civilians carrying away the injured. Three men helped one of those hit in the attack his face drenched in blood and his features almost completely obscured. Nearby the body of a man in a blue shirt and dark trousers lay where he had died. Civil defence workers rushed alongside civilians to evacuate the injured with one man in a thick beanie hat carrying a wailing child in a pink sweater away from the scene. Elsewhere the bodies of at least three children were laid out on the ground partly covered by thick bolts of fabric. Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed under a deal earlier this year between Syrias allies Russia and Iran and rebel backer Turkey. The zone mostly covers neighbouring Idlib province which is largely held by opposition forces and a jihadist group formerly affiliated with Al-Qaeda.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on the market in Idlib provinces Maaret al-Numan were probably carried out by regime forces. Much of Idlib province including Maaret al-Numan is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) a group led by Al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate. Idlib is one of four so-called ""de-escalation"" zones under a deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran in May. However the HTS is not party to the agreement. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said ""military aircraft"" had targeted the market in Maaret al-Numan blaming the regime for the strike. ""At least 11 people were killed including two children"" he said. ""There are around 20 wounded and the toll of victims could rise."" The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The Observatory said that on Friday and Saturday at least 13 civilians died in suspected regime air strikes around Khan Sheikhun the site of a deadly April chemical attack. Despite months of relative calm in Idlib Syrian regime and Russian forces have in recent weeks carried out air raids across the province killing dozens of civilians according to the Observatory.

For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al-Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo.

""Dozens more were wounded some of them critically"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said adding it was not immediately able to determine who carried out the Tuesday raids. The Syrian government its ally Russia and a US-led coalition have all carried out air strikes against IS in Raqa. The Observatory said there were fresh air strikes against the city on Wednesday one of which hit the town hall. It said those strikes appeared to have been carried out by the coalition. The coalition said it had carried out two strikes near Raqa on Monday hitting a bridge used by the jihadists as well as oil facilities. There are an estimated 300000 people still living in the city. Activists have accused IS of preventing civilians from leaving in order to use them as human shields against air strikes. Twin offensives aimed at severing ISs supply route to Raqa from the Turkish border have met fierce resistance from the jihadists in recent days. Near the border a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters has been encircling IS in the town of Manbij for days but has faced multiple suicide bombings by the jihadists. At least three IS suicide bombers attacked the Syrian Democratic Forces near Manbij on Tuesday the Observatory said.

More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the Observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The Observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control - Zeitan Khalsa and Barna - causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front which like IS group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.,ahram,6/18/2016,aleppo,1,syria rebel kill 7 aleppo assault captur 3 villag monitor reuter saturday 18 jun 2016 least seven peopl die rebel shell neighbourhood syrian citi aleppo held kurdish ypg militia dawn saturday monitor group said rebel took territori south 40 peopl also wound attack sheikh maqsoud area britainbas syrian observatori human right said district next way rebelheld part northern citi castello road escal air artilleri strike recent week around road made virtual impass put hundr thousand peopl aleppo effect sieg hundr peopl kill aleppo sinc peac talk broke april syria presid bashar alassad seek regain control syria largest prewar citi split rebel govern sector rebel said past attack sheikh maqsoud respons ypg attempt cut castello road ypg control nearli syria northern frontier turkey close alli unit state campaign islam state group syria mani rebel western syria trust ypg say cooper damascu rather fight accus ypg deni heavi bombard sheikh maqsoud intens bombard sinc midfebruari kill 132 civilian injur around 900 observatori said 48hour ceasefir aleppo announc russia thursday littl impact fight air strike shell continu around citi sinc three peopl two children die nine peopl injur barrel bomb drop helicopt citi observatori said saturday white helmet group civil defenc emerg worker oper rebelheld area said twitter one build haritan north aleppo countrysid hit air strike saturday injuri observatori also said saturday rebel captur three villag south aleppo govern control zeitan khalsa barna caus signific loss among govern forc alli villag near main highway within rebel territori link aleppo capit damascu south lie area captur govern forc end last year larg offens assist iranianback militia russian air power syrian observatori said lack russian air support week battl villag least 86 member syrian govern forc alli includ member lebanes group hezbollah iranianback militia kill fight south aleppo area past four day observatori said number could independ confirm rebel fight alongsid al qaedaaffili nusra front like group exclud februari ceasefir geneva peac talk
1923848267,Air strikes in Syrias Idlib kill more than 20 Monitor,Air strikes in Syrias Idlib kill more than 20 Monitor Reuters Sunday 12 Jun 2016 Air strikes carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes killed more than 20 people in the northwestern city of Idlib on Sunday monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Areas hit included a market and at least five children were among those killed the British-based Observatory said. It said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of people seriously wounded. It said it did not know whether Syrian or Russian jets had carried out the strikes. Both are operating in the area. Russia deployed warplanes to Syria last year to support President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to end his rule and have supported Syrian government forces in a separate fight against Islamic State (IS) group further east. Idlib city and the province by the same name is a stronghold of rebel groups including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Air raids in the town of Maarat al-Numan about 30 km (20 miles) south of Idlib killed another six people the Observatory said. There has been heavy bombardment of areas in Idlib province in recent weeks including air strikes that killed at least 23 people last month. Fighting in Syrias five-year civil war has intensified since a February ceasefire deal which took hold in the west of the country but excluded al Qaeda and IS group but quickly began to unravel.,ahram,6/14/2016,idlib,1,air strike syria idlib kill 20 monitor reuter sunday 12 jun 2016 air strike carri syrian russian warplan kill 20 peopl northwestern citi idlib sunday monitor group syrian observatori human right report area hit includ market least five children among kill britishbas observatori said said death toll expect rise number peopl serious wound said know whether syrian russian jet carri strike oper area russia deploy warplan syria last year support presid bashar alassad rebel seek end rule support syrian govern forc separ fight islam state group east idlib citi provinc name stronghold rebel group includ al qaedalink nusra front air raid town maarat alnuman 30 km 20 mile south idlib kill anoth six peopl observatori said heavi bombard area idlib provinc recent week includ air strike kill least 23 peopl last month fight syria fiveyear civil war intensifi sinc februari ceasefir deal took hold west countri exclud al qaeda group quickli began unravel
1923848268,17 civilians dead in air strikes on market in east Syria Monitor,17 civilians dead in air strikes on market in east Syria Monitor AFP Monday 6 Jun 2016 seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air strikes on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes on Al-Shaara a town held by the Islamic State (IS) group in Deir Ezzor province were suspected to have been carried out by either Russian or Syrian government planes. The death toll is likely to rise due to the serious condition of some of the wounded Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Residents from nearby villages typically flock to the Al-Shaara market to do their shopping Abdel Rahman said. Heavy air strikes hit IS group -held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Ezzor from early Monday he said. IS controls more than 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the oil-rich province of the same name most of which has been in its hands since 2013. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year-old conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Regime air strikes killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir Ezzor city on Friday according to the monitor.,ahram,6/6/2016,deir ezzor,0,17 civilian dead air strike market east syria monitor afp monday 6 jun 2016 seventeen civilian includ eight children kill air strike market eastern syria monday first day holi muslim month ramadan monitor said syrian observatori human right said strike alshaara town held islam state group deir ezzor provinc suspect carri either russian syrian govern plane death toll like rise due seriou condit wound observatori chief rami abdel rahman said resid nearbi villag typic flock alshaara market shop abdel rahman said heavi air strike hit group held area outsid divid citi deir ezzor earli monday said control 60 percent deir ezzor citi capit oilrich provinc name hand sinc 2013 observatori reli network sourc insid syria gather inform fiveyearold conflict kill 280000 peopl displac million say determin whether strike carri syrian russian usl coalit aircraft base locat raid flight pattern type plane munit involv regim air strike kill least 15 civilian isheld area boleel outsid deir ezzor citi friday accord monitor

The crude unguided explosive device hit the Qaterji neighbourhood where an AFP photographer saw a street strewn with rubble as residents ran for safety and a rescuer rushed a bloodied child into an ambulance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others including a child were killed in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily ""There are only civilians here there are no rebels!"" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the raids that also hit several neighbourhoods in Idlib and wounded at least 90 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor could not immediately confirm how many of the casualties were civilians saying some bodies ""were burned beyond recognition"". An AFP photographer in Idlib saw men clambering over rubble in just slippers or sandals to help evacuate wounded dust-covered residents and children from a collapsing building. Others tried to lift a bloodied shopper who had collapsed on the ground as a fire raged in a nearby open-air clothes market. A man his hand pressing a bloodied wound on his hand walked away clutching the hand of a barefooted boy. The raids also destroyed several shops and cars in the area. After marathon talks in Geneva US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a ceasefire would begin Monday the first day of the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha. If the deal is implemented Syrias armed forces would stop air strikes on rebel-held areas and desperately-needed aid would reach war-weary civilians. UN investigators last week said aerial bombardment by Syrian forces and their Russian ally namely in Idlib and Aleppo were causing huge civilian casualties and destroying vital infrastructure. Since spring 2015 most of Idlib province has been held by an alliance of rebels Islamists and jihadists known as the Army of Conquest. The Army of Conquest - led by the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after renouncing ties with Al-Qaeda - is regularly bombarded by pro-government forces.

1923848279,Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo,"Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo AFP Sunday 30 Oct 2016 Syrias regime and rebels were locked in fierce fighting Sunday on Aleppos western edges where 38 civilians have been killed in a two-day opposition offensive to break the government siege. Rebels and allied militants launched a major offensive on Friday to break through government lines and reach the 250000 people living in the citys east. Since then they have unleashed a salvo of rockets artillery shells and car bombs around the western government-controlled districts. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the countrys five-year civil war which has killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage. ""Rebel fighters have launched hundreds of rockets and shells onto the western districts from positions inside the city and on its western edges"" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two days of such heavy rebel bombardment have killed 38 civilians including 14 children and wounded another 250. Fighting has also killed 30 regime and allied fighters as well as 50 Syrian rebels according to the Observatory. The monitor did not have an immediate death toll for foreign anti-regime fighters many of whom have joined the militants factions. About 1500 rebels have massed on a 15-kilometre front along the western edges of Aleppo since Friday scoring quick gains in the Dahiyet al-Assad district but struggling to push east since then. ""The advance will be from Dahiyet al-Assad towards Hamdaniyeh"" said Yasser al-Youssef of the Noureddin al-Zinki rebel faction. Hamdaniyeh is a regime-held district directly adjacent to opposition-controlled eastern neighbourhoods. Fighting lasted all night and into Sunday with air strikes and artillery fire along the western battlefronts heard even in the eastern districts an AFP correspondent there said. Plumes of smoke could be seen snaking up from the citys skyline. A pro-regime military source told AFP that the rebel assault was ""massive and coordinated"" but insisted it was unable to break into any neighbourhoods besides Dahiyet al-Assad. ""Theyre using Grad missiles and car bombs and are supported by foreign fighters in their ranks"" he said. Those waging the assault include Aleppo rebels and reinforcements from Idlib province to the west among them the militant Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking ties with Al-Qaeda. Aleppos front line runs through the heart of the city dividing rebels in the east from government troops in the west. In late September government troops launched their own assault to recapture all of the eastern rebel-controlled territory. It was backed by fierce air strikes from Russia which launched its own air war in 2015 to back President Bashar al-Assads forces. That onslaught spurred massive international criticism of both Moscow and Damascus.

Rebel groups including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham faction and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front fired waves of rockets into government-held western Aleppo killing at least 15 civilians a monitor said. The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. ""We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes"" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree. ""The Russian president considers it inappropriate at the current moment to resume strikes on Aleppo"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adding that Putin thought it was necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in the war-ravaged city. ""The Russian side retains the right in case of extreme necessity to use all the troops and facilities it has to carry out support of the Syrian armed forces at the necessary level"" he added. Fridays rebel assault comes more than three months into a government siege of eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people live and several weeks after the army began an operation to retake the rebel east. Rebel groups ""announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo"" said Abu Yusef Muhajir a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham. The assault ""will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside"" he told AFP. ""The breaking of the siege is inevitable"" said Yasser al-Yusef a member of the political office of the Nureddine al-Zinki rebel group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said at least 15 civilians including a woman and two children had been killed and more than 100 wounded in rebel fire on western Aleppo. The monitor reported fierce clashes on multiple fronts on the western and southern outskirts of west Aleppo with three suicide car bombs targeting a checkpoint in the Dahiyet al-Assad neighbourhood. Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting ""God is greatest"" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed ""a divine no-fly zone"". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled. Rebels also fired rockets from Idlib province into the government stronghold of Latakia killing one person and wounding six. Rockets struck close to the Hmeimim military airport as well as near President Bashar al-Assads ancestral village Qardaha the monitor said. State television said ""the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them"". State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out air strikes south and west of Aleppo. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city. The UNs aid chief Stephen OBrien this week said Aleppo had become ""a kill zone"" adding that ""nothing is actually happening to stop the war stop the suffering"". Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of ""not being professional enough"" over Aleppo. Speaking in Moscow after meeting the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers he said ""Their inaction allowed the medical evacuation to be sabotaged."" UN chief Ban Ki-moon meanwhile condemned an attack on a school in government-held west Aleppo on Thursday that killed at killed at least six children according to state media.

A monitoring group said a child was also among at least eight people killed in government shelling on the rebel-held town of Douma outside Damascus. ""Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo"" state news agency SANA reported. The neighbourhood is in the western outskirts of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Rebels regularly fire crude homemade rockets into the west of the city often killing civilians. Government forces backed by ally Russia have waged an aerial and ground assault since late September to recapture eastern Aleppo killing hundreds of civilians and destroying infrastructure including hospitals. The deaths came a day after the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in air strikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass prompting outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly. Outside Damascus meanwhile at least eight people were killed on Thursday in government shelling on Douma in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region the British-based Observatory said. Douma is regularly targeted by government fire and in recent months regime forces have waged an offensive in the area which has also been under siege since 2013.

The report comes amid fierce clashes on the outskirts of Damascus between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant which is spearheading a major offensive in Iraq and rebels the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""ISIL executed eight men in Deir Hafer in the east of Aleppo province"" on Saturday because they belonged to rebel groups that had fought against the jihadists as well as Assads forces it said. ISIL then ""crucified them in the main square of the village where their bodies will remain for three days"" the Britain-based monitor said. Also in Aleppo province a ninth man was executed and crucified in Al-Bab town near the border with Turkey. ISIL first emerged in Syrias war in late spring last year and was initially welcomed by some Syrian rebels who believed its combat experience would help topple Assad. But subsequent jihadist abuses quickly turned the Syrian opposition including Islamists against ISIL. Rebels launched a major anti-ISIL offensive in January 2014 and have pushed them out of large swathes of Aleppo province and all of Idlib in the northwest. However ISIL remains firmly rooted in Raqa its northern Syrian headquarters and wields significant power in Deir Ezzor in the east near the border with Iraq. Activists say the groups Iraq offensive and capture of heavy weapons - some of them US-made - appears to have boosted its confidence in Syria. East of Damascus ""fierce clashes broke out early Sunday between rebels from the Army of Islam and ISIL near the town of Hammuriyeh"" the Observatory said. The Army of Islam is a major component of the Islamic Front Syrias largest rebel coalition which has been fighting ISIL for months but such fighting in Damascus province is unprecedented. Regime soldiers and warplanes backed by Lebanons Shiite Hezbollah also pounded rebel positions near the capital with rockets and surface-to-surface missiles said the Local Coordination Committees activist network. Syrias war began as a peaceful protest movement in March 2011 demanding political change but became an armed insurgency when Assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown.

1923848295,Jihadists execute three Syria rebel officers Monitor,"Jihadists execute three Syria rebel officers Monitor AFP Saturday 21 Jun 2014 Jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have executed three officers of the Western and Arab-backed rebel Free Syrian Army a monitor said Saturday. The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from ""friendly and brotherly Arab nations"" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor.

Videos and images posted by opposition supporters online showed a massive plume of smoke and earth shooting into the air near a small town as men shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad regularly carry out guerrilla attacks against his forces but the size of the blast which occurred on Monday was unusual. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said the blast took place outside the town of Maarat al-Numan in the northwestern Idlib province. At least two officers were among those killed when insurgents from the Islamic Front and the Shields of the Revolution Council set off tonnes of explosives in a tunnel running from the road to the checkpoint the group said. More than 150000 people have been killed in the three-year-old rebellion which started as a peaceful protest movement and turned into a civil war after a government crackdown. International powers have been deadlocked over how to resolve the conflict further complicated by infighting between rebel groups that has killed thousands of fighters this year. On Monday about 70 rebels were killed in clashes between a former al Qaeda affiliate the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al Qaedas Syrian branch the Nusra Front and its allies in an eastern province bordering Iraq the Observatory said.

Another 100 people were wounded in Karam al-Luz in attacks SANA blamed on ""terrorists"" the governments term for people fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. ""Twenty-five people fell as martyrs including women and children and more than 107 others were wounded after the explosion of the two car bombs"" a half-hour apart SANA said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombings killed 21 people in a mostly Alawite neighbourhood referring to the Shiite Muslim offshoot sect to which the Assad family belongs. Videos posted online by activists showed destroyed shopfronts and people panicking and running in all directions as rescuers struggled to extinguish a fire. Syrias uprising began as a series of peaceful protests against the Assad familys four-decade rule but escalated into a full-scale insurgency after the regime launched a devastating crackdown on dissent. More than 150000 people have been killed since the revolt began in March 2011 and nine million have been driven from their homes including 2.6 million international refugees. Homs was an epicentre of the revolt but is now almost entirely in regime hands with small pockets of rebels holding out in besieged areas in and around the devastated Old City. Earlier Wednesday troops fighting in the Qalamun region seized the town of Rankus tightening their grip on the strategic region along the Lebanese border. ""Units of the Syrian army have now accomplished their operation in the Rankus area and restored security and stability after eliminating a large number of terrorists"" state media said. The Britain-based Observatory had earlier confirmed that ""the army entered the area and is engaged in fierce fighting and heavy shelling."" The group with a network of sources inside Syria said 28 rebels had been killed in Qalamun area as well as in Eastern Ghouta elsewhere in Damascus province in fighting between Tuesday and Wednesday.

In the capital meanwhile two people were killed when mortar fire struck the Damascus Opera House. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 29 rebels were killed in the besieged Old City of Homs when a car bomb exploded. ""The death toll is likely to rise because there are dozens of people missing and body parts in the area of the blast"" the Britain-based group said. State news agency SANA also reported the blast saying a car had exploded while being loaded with explosives. The blast took place on the outskirts of the besieged Old City of Homs which is under rebel control. Some 1400 civilians were able to leave the area this year under UN supervision but an estimated 1500 people remain until the army siege.

1923848317,More than 50 Syria rebels jihadists killed NGO - Region - World - Ahram Online,"More than 50 Syria rebels jihadists killed NGO AFP Sunday 30 Mar 2014 More than 50 rebels and jihadists were killed in fighting in northeast Syrias Hasakeh province as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) overran a town bordering Iraq an NGO said Sunday. ""The number of Al-Nusra Front and rebel fighters killed in battles (Saturday) against ISIL in the strategic town of Markada in the south of Hasake province has risen to 39"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said ISIL lost 13 of its fighters as it took total control of Markada. ""Markada is important because it provides ISIL with a supply route from Iraq into the road linking Hasake to Deir Ezzor"" said the Observatory. Oil-rich Hasake and Deir Ezzor provinces border Iraq where ISIL has its roots. ISIL has been fighting a war against rebels including the Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front since January across large swathes of western northern and eastern Syria. Once allied to ISIL Syrias rebels and Al-Nusra turned against the jihadists angered by their quest for hegemony and abuses. While ISIL has withdrawn from much of the west and north of Syria it has held its ground firmly in the east near the Iraqi border. On another front fighting raged in flashpoints of Latakia province on the Mediterranean coastline where rebels and Al-Nusra Front began a surprise offensive against the army last week. Latakia is the heartland of both President Bashar al-Assads clan and his Alawite sect. Since late last week the rebels have taken over a key border crossing with Turkey at Kasab and a handful of villages. On Sunday the fighting was focused around the village of Qustul Maaf and the Nisr mountain which is surrounded by rebels. The battle in Latakia has killed some 300 fighters on both sides the Observatory said including 180 army and paramilitary troops loyal to Assads regime.

""At least six people were killed including women and children and 20 others wounded in a car bomb attack on the Zahraa district"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based group with a network of contacts inside Syria. State news agency SANA confirmed the report. Homs has seen some of Syrias worst violence since the outbreak of the revolt against Assad three years ago which was met by a brutal crackdown that spawned a civil war. Only a handful of districts in the heart of the city remain in rebel control. Besieged for nearly two years residents there survive on little more than herbs and suffer daily shelling. Fighting raged further north in Syrias second city Aleppo between rebels and regime loyalists as helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on an opposition area of the city the Observatory said. At least one man was killed by regime shelling while clashes raged on the citys front lines the group said adding that 11 troops were killed in Mondays fighting. The rebel Army of Mujahideen meanwhile detained prominent female activist Marcel Shehwaro and her friend Mohammad Khalili in Aleppo after she refused to don the Islamic headscarf according to local activists. The pair were taken to the Islamic court for questioning with activists saying they would protest at the court to demand their release.

1924058031,Israeli attack on Syria military camp kills three | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 232017 An Israeli attack on a Syrian training camp near the Golan Heights killed three members of a pro-government militia on Sunday an official from the forces said. The Al Fawwar camp in Syrias southwestern Quneitra province is used by the National Defence Forces (NDF) which command some 90000 fighters across Syria. The NDF official told AFP that two fighters were also wounded in the Israeli attack but said it was unclear whether the damage was inflicted by an air strike or shelling. Another Syrian source inside the training camp told AFP that around 600am local time (0300 GMT) ""security guards at the camp saw what looked like three fireballs coming towards the camp"". ""Then there were several consecutive blasts because of the explosion of ammunition warehouses"" that firefighters worked hard to extinguish the source said. The source also said that they were ""Israeli rockets"" but could not specify what kind of missiles may have been used. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the attack had targeted a ""weapons warehouse"" in the camp. Israels army declined to comment Sunday on the attack. On Friday the Israeli army said it targeted positions inside Syria in retaliation for mortar fire that hit the northern part of the Golan Heights. At the time Syrias official news agency SANA said Israel had struck a Syrian army position in the province of Quneitra on the Golan plateau ""causing damage"". The Syrian government labels rebel groups and militants fighting the regime as ""terrorists"" and accuses Israel of backing them. Israel seized 1200 square kilometres of the Golan from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Around 510 square kilometres of the Golan are under Syrian control. The two countries are still technically at war although the border remained largely quiet for decades until 2011 when the Syrian conflict broke out.

1924058032,Dozens dead as car bomb hits Syria evacuees | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 152017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes.

1924058034,Strike kills 15 near Syrias Daesh-held Raqqa monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Apr 092017 At least 15 civilians including four children were killed in a suspected US-led coalition air strike on Saturday near the Daesh terror groups Syrian bastion Raqqa a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17 people were injured in the strike on Heneyda and that the death toll could rise further because several of the wounded were in serious conditions. The Britain-based group said the strike was suspected to have been carried out by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Heneyda is around 25 kilometres west of the city of Raqqa the target of a major operation led by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters and backed by the US-led coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have for months been advancing towards the city in the north of the country hoping to encircle it before launching a final assault. Its forces last month seized the Tabaqa military airport from Daesh and have entered the complex of the key Tabqa dam after being airlifted behind jihadist lines by US forces. They continue to battle for the town of Tabqa around 40 kilometres west of Raqqa with clashes ongoing on Saturday the observatory said.

1924058036,Outrage as Syria _chemical attack_ kills dozens in rebel-held town | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 052017 KHAN SHEIKHUN Syria A suspected chemical attack in rebel-held northwestern Syria killed dozens of civilians including children and left many more sick and gasping on Tuesday causing widespread outrage. The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming ""terrorist groups"" for using ""chemical and toxic substances"". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a ""reprehensible"" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was ""confident in its assessment"" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the ""best interest"" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a ""clear identification of responsibilities and accountability"". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released ""toxic gas"". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters. I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course.",jordantimes,4/15/2017,idlib,1,last updat apr 052017 khan sheikhun syria suspect chemic attack rebelheld northwestern syria kill dozen civilian includ children left mani sick gasp tuesday caus widespread outrag attack town khan sheikhun kill least 58 civilian saw dozen suffer respiratori problem symptom includ vomit faint foam mouth syrian observatori human right monitor group said syria opposit blame presid bashar assad forc say attack cast doubt futur peac talk armi deni involv howev issu statement blame terrorist group use chemic toxic substanc least 11 children among dead observatori said afp correspond khan sheikhun saw mani attach respir confirm would one worst chemic attack sinc start syria civil war six year ago incid brought swift intern condemn unit state franc britain point finger assad us blame damascu white hous condemn said reprehens attack carri assad forc spokesman sean spicer said presid donald trump brief extens incid ad us confid assess damascu blame spicer also suggest best interest syrian assad lead countri un envoy staffan de mistura said attack believ chemic launch air ad clear identif respons account observatori said attack residenti part khan sheikhun came earli tuesday morn warplan carri strike releas toxic ga well kill least 160 peopl injur said mani die even arriv medic facil monitor could confirm natur ga said attack like carri govern warplan heard strike morn ran insid hous saw whole famili dead bed children women old peopl dead street resid abu mustafa said russia militari fight support assad govern sinc septemb 2015 deni carri strike near town hour initi attack air strike also hit hospit town doctor treat victim afp correspond said bring rubbl top medic work saw young girl woman two elderli peopl dead hospit father carri dead littl girl lip blueish dark curl visibl wrap sheet doctor work warplan circl overhead strike first near facil hit twice inflict sever damag prompt nearli dozen medic staff flee speak afp medic hazem shehwan said victim suffer symptom includ pinpoint pupil convuls foam mouth rapid puls armi denial khan sheikhun idlib provinc larg control allianc rebel includ former al qaeda affili fateh al sham front provinc regularli target govern russian air strike also hit usl coalit fight daesh group usual target extremist syria lead opposit group nation coalit blame assad attack demand un open immedi investig hold respons account failur understood messag bless regim action said damascu offici join chemic weapon convent turn declar chemic arsen 2013 part deal avert us militari action agreement came hundr peopl 1429 accord us intellig report kill chemic weapon strike allegedli carri govern troop east southwest damascu repeat alleg chemic weapon use sinc unl investig point finger regim least three chlorin attack 2014 2015 armi deni use chemic weapon tuesday insist never use time anywher futur global chemic arm watchdog said serious concern report attack organis prohibit chemic weapon opcw said gather analys inform avail sourc un commiss inquiri syria said begun investig alleg use chemic weapon peac talk doubt 320000 peopl kill syria sinc conflict began march 2011 antigovern protest success round peac talk includ unsponsor meet geneva last week fail produc polit breakthrough tuesday attack cast new doubt peac process said opposit chief negoti mohamad sabra unit nation cannot deter regim carri crime achiev process lead polit transit syria told afp senior syrian secur sourc told afp opposit forc tri achiev media could achiev ground spread imag alleg attack site un secur council hold emerg meet wednesday discuss attack follow call franc britain ive seen report use sarin far know confirm british ambassador un matthew rycroft said clearli war crime rycroft told report call secur council member previous use veto defend indefens chang cours
1924058037,Five dead as Russian military helicopter downed in Syria | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Aug 012016 BEIRUT A Russian military helicopter was shot down over Syria on Monday killing all five people on board in the single deadliest incident for Moscow since it intervened in the war. The attack came as Syrian opposition fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regimes siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russias defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. ""A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo"" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. ""As far as we know from the information weve had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a ""terrorist act"" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen ""through all possible channels"". It was not immediately clear who was responsible. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Russian forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assads government last September. It brought the total number of members of the Russian forces killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies. Elsewhere in Aleppo province the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance advanced inside the Daesh terror group bastion of Manbij on Monday the observatory reported. The SDF hold approximately 40 per cent of the town and are fighting to take it with support from the US-led coalition against Daesh.",jordantimes,8/19/2016,aleppo,1,last updat aug 012016 beirut russian militari helicopt shot syria monday kill five peopl board singl deadliest incid moscow sinc interven war attack came syrian opposit fighter alli battl govern forc outsid aleppo bid eas regim sieg rebelheld part northern citi russia defenc ministri announc down helicopt said carri three crew two offic russian mi8 militari transport helicopt shot ground deliv humanitarian aid aleppo defenc ministri said statement quot russian news agenc kremlin said five peopl board assum dead far know inform weve defenc ministri helicopt die die heroic tri move aircraft away minimis victim ground kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov told journalist lieuten gener sergei rudskoy call down terrorist act said defenc ministri still tri confirm fate russian servicemen possibl channel immedi clear respons incid deadliest singl attack russian forc syria sinc moscow began intervent support presid bashar assad govern last septemb brought total number member russian forc kill syria 18 syrian observatori human right britainbas monitor said helicopt come along administr border idlib provinc northwest neighbour aleppo idlib held almost entir power coalit islamist jihadist forc includ former al nusra front known fateh al sham front renounc statu al qaeda syrian affili aleppo rebel assault neighbour aleppo provinc fateh al sham front alli rebel group fight fierc battl monday regim troop outskirt aleppo citi clash part assault launch sunday tri eas govern sieg rebelheld east citi observatori said rebel advanc overnight south southwest aleppo report ongo fight well govern air strike battlefield rebelheld eastern neighbourhood syria econom powerhous aleppo citi roughli divid govern control west rebel control east sinc mid2012 recent week govern forc encircl east cut sole suppli rout rais fear humanitarian crisi estim 250000 peopl sieg primari goal rebel assault seiz ramussa neighbourhood citi southern outskirt road run ramussa main suppli rout regim forc go area control western aleppo said observatori head rami abdel rahman also use civilian enter leav governmentcontrol district aleppo take detour north would danger ad islamist group ahrar al sham said twitter involv fierc clash near ramussa advanc toward rout state news agenc sana said rebel rocket sniper fire near ramussa monday kill four peopl includ three women observatori put toll six dead humanitarian corridor sana said peopl use rout usual resid western aleppo express fear assault could cut milit break sieg besieg us cut khanass rout arteri said hossam qassab 32yearold pharmacist syrian secur sourc acknowledg assault said govern forc repel encircl eastern aleppo rais fear starvat remain resid report food shortag spiral price sinc govern sieg began juli 17 last week moscow announc open humanitarian corridor east govern territori civilian surrend rebel saturday moscow syrian offici media report dozen civilian fled via corridor resid rebel ground dismiss report lie elsewher aleppo provinc syrian democrat forc sdf usback kurdisharab allianc advanc insid daesh terror group bastion manbij monday observatori report sdf hold approxim 40 per cent town fight take support usl coalit daesh
1924058038,Dozens dead as warplanes pound rebel-held north Syria | Jordan Times,Last updated at Aug 142016 Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said.

1924058042,At least 70 killed in north of Syria_s Aleppo _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.,jordantimes,7/6/2016,aleppo,1,last updat jul 012016 beirut least 70 regim rebel fighter kill 24 hour govern assault extremistl counterattack northern syria monitor said thursday syrian observatori human right said 30 regim soldier 39 rebel fighter kill battl around al maleh north aleppo sinc wednesday afternoon extremist fight al nusra front syrian branch al qaeda also kill said observatori head rami abdel rahman provid precis number govern presid bashar assad attempt seiz al maleh two year forc tri month surround aleppo cut suppli line rebelheld district citi nearbi turkey support opposit forc nearli week regim troop back syrian russian warplan battl control al maleh assad regim also attempt cut castello road key suppli rout turkish border rebelheld eastern suburb aleppo proregim websit al masdar news report syrian armi withdrew farm al maleh face rebel counteroffens led al nusra front said rebel attack govern forc two suicid car bomb observatori said two children kill regim bomb rebelheld area aleppo major aleppo provinc control al nusra islamist alli citi countri prewar commerci capit divid sinc juli 2012 rebelheld regimeheld area five civilian includ three children also kill regim bomb land eastern ghouta observatori report thursday
1924058046,Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 282016 QAMISHLI Syria A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in.

1924058047,Syria regime advances on rebels in Aleppo _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. ""The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege"" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to ""join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries"" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.",jordantimes,7/13/2016,aleppo,1,last updat jul 262016 beirut syrian govern forc tuesday seiz rebelheld neighbourhood northwest edg aleppo tighten sieg oppositioncontrol part citi monitor said govern also carri renew barrel bomb attack oppositionheld district day bombard kill least 24 peopl syrian observatori human right said britainbas monitor said regim troop full control leramun district heavi clash also report intens fight neighbour rebelheld district bani zeid two area use rebel launch rocket governmentheld district citi west aleppo roughli divid govern control west rebel control east sinc mid2012 recent week regim advanc sever remain rout rebelheld eastern neighbourhood effect place sieg opposit forc respond fire missil govern district kill score civilian import captur leramun bani zeid stop missil fire also tighten sieg said observatori director rami abdel rahman said govern forc surround bani zeid report heavi air strike area clash monitor immedi toll fight govern forc effect sever opposit main suppli rout juli 7 advanc within fire rang castello road sinc tighten encircl rebelheld east take part road caus food shortag spiral price opposit neighbourhood syria al watan daili close govern also report advanc leramun industri area hous score factori state news agenc sana broadcast call militari urg resid eastern aleppo join nation reconcili expel foreign mercenari neighbourhood said armi sent text messag resid fighter east urg rebel lay weapon identifi safe passag civilian wish leav govern forc continu pound opposit area tuesday observatori report new barrel bomb attack district al mashhad said five civilian includ three children kill monday least 24 peopl includ five children two women kill barrel bomb attack neighbourhood accord new toll observatori statement un children agenc unicef tuesday condemn weekend air raid four hospit aleppo call blatant violat intern humanitarian law may amount war crime humanitarian front 48truck aid convoy tuesday enter regimebesieg talbiseh hom provinc food suppli 40000 peopl intern committe red cross said 280000 peopl kill syria sinc conflict began march 2011 antigovern protest met regim crackdown
1924058050,13 civilians killed in regime air raids on northern Syria | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 152015 A member of the Syrian regime forces runs near destroyed buildings in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakeh on Monday (AFP photo) BEIRUT Thirteen civilians among them seven children were killed in aerial attacks by Syrias government Wednesday on the northern province of Aleppo a monitoring group said. A woman and her three children as well as another child were killed when helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on the village of Taduf said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Taduf which lies in the northeast of Syrias Aleppo province is controlled by the Daesh terror group. In the provinces west eight civilians including three children were killed when regime warplanes struck the village of Daret Izza held by Islamist fighters and other rebels. Regime forces are continuing to kill civilians through aerial attacks with barrel bombs or shells indifferent to the international resolutions on this matter said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said the attacks amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by regime forces on a daily basis. Abdel Rahman told AFP the bombing campaign was an effort by the regime to turn civilians against the opposition factions or against IS with the reasoning that the aerial attacks are a result of the presence of fighters inside their towns and villages. The regime has stepped up air attacks in Aleppo province in recent days killing at least 57 civilians when it dropped container bombs on the Daesh-held town of Al Bab at the weekend. Also Wednesday 22 Daesh fighters were killed when regime warplanes struck a convoy traveling between the provinces of Deir Ezzor in the east and Hasakeh in the northeast.

1924058051,Barrel bombs kill 11 civilians in Daesh town in Syria | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jul 172015 Barrel bombs dropped from Syrian government helicopters on Thursday killed at least 11 civilians including three children in raids on a jihadist-held northern town a monitoring group said. The crudely constructed weapons were used on Al Bab which lies in Aleppo province and is held by the extremist Daesj group according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since Saturday at least 68 civilians have been killed in aerial attacks on the town. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the ""intensified air attacks by regime forces on Al Bab are aimed at foiling Daesh efforts on multiple fronts"" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which Daesh has besieged for more than a year. Al Bab is strategically important because it is one of Daeshs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he told AFP. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town. Syrias embattled regime has heavily bombarded areas in Aleppo province that have fallen out of its control. To the west in Idlib province an alliance of rebels and Islamist fighters heavily shelled the provinces last two regime-held Shiite villages for the second consecutive day. The Army of Conquest an opposition coalition that includes Al Qaedas Syria affiliate Al Nusra Front began its assault on Fuaa and Kafraya on Wednesday. ""Dozens of shells fell overnight Wednesday and into Thursday morning on Fuaa and Kafraya which are largely inhabited by Shiite Muslims"" the observatory said. Abdel Rahman said there were casualties but had no immediate toll. The Army of Conquest said Wednesday its attack was a response to an offensive by the army and the Lebanese Shiite movement Hizbollah on Zabadani the last rebel-held bastion along the Syrian-Lebanese border. Clashes in Zabadani raged on Thursday according to the observatory which has documented heavy shelling on the town since early July. Elsewhere on Thursday the observatory said 17 government troops including a commander were killed in fighting with the Daesh group near the city of Palmyra. Among the dead was Major General Mohsen Makhlouf of a tank battalion in area of central Homs province the monitor said. Palmyra which is famed for its ancient ruins has been under Daesh control since May but in recent weeks government troops have advanced to within a few kilometres of the city. In northeastern Syria Kurdish forces backed by government shelling took an area south of the city of Hasakeh from Daesh forces the observatory said. Daesh entered the city where security control is divided between Kurdish and regime forces on June 25 seizing territory in its southern districts. But the Kurdish fighters along with a group of Sunni Arab tribesman are hoping to encircle the Daesh forces by taking a strip of territory outside the city. At least 230000 people have been killed in Syrias multi-front conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests but devolved into a civil war.",jordantimes,7/19/2015,aleppo,0,last updat jul 172015 barrel bomb drop syrian govern helicopt thursday kill least 11 civilian includ three children raid jihadistheld northern town monitor group said crude construct weapon use al bab lie aleppo provinc held extremist daesj group accord syrian observatori human right sinc saturday least 68 civilian kill aerial attack town observatori head rami abdel rahman said intensifi air attack regim forc al bab aim foil daesh effort multipl front includ nearbi kweyri militari airport daesh besieg year al bab strateg import one daesh closest posit regimeheld part aleppo told afp may 60 civilian kill barrel bomb attack town syria embattl regim heavili bombard area aleppo provinc fallen control west idlib provinc allianc rebel islamist fighter heavili shell provinc last two regimeheld shiit villag second consecut day armi conquest opposit coalit includ al qaeda syria affili al nusra front began assault fuaa kafraya wednesday dozen shell fell overnight wednesday thursday morn fuaa kafraya larg inhabit shiit muslim observatori said abdel rahman said casualti immedi toll armi conquest said wednesday attack respons offens armi lebanes shiit movement hizbollah zabadani last rebelheld bastion along syrianlebanes border clash zabadani rage thursday accord observatori document heavi shell town sinc earli juli elsewher thursday observatori said 17 govern troop includ command kill fight daesh group near citi palmyra among dead major gener mohsen makhlouf tank battalion area central hom provinc monitor said palmyra fame ancient ruin daesh control sinc may recent week govern troop advanc within kilometr citi northeastern syria kurdish forc back govern shell took area south citi hasakeh daesh forc observatori said daesh enter citi secur control divid kurdish regim forc june 25 seiz territori southern district kurdish fighter along group sunni arab tribesman hope encircl daesh forc take strip territori outsid citi least 230000 peopl kill syria multifront conflict began 2011 antigovern protest devolv civil war
1924058052,Syria regime air strikes kill at least 39 _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jan 202015 Beirut Syrian government air strikes on Tuesday killed at least 39 people more than half of them civilians in two main battlegrounds in the north of the country a monitor said. ""The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of at least 27 people... in air strikes targeting the outskirts of Tal Hamis"" said the Britain-based organisation. Speaking to AFP Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said nine of those killed had been identified by his group as civilians. ""More of the dead may be civilians too but we have not yet been able to confirm that"" Abdel Rahman said. He added that Tal Hamis situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group. Tuesdays bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market. ""Some of the bodies were so mutilated by the strikes that people couldnt tell the human from the animal remains"" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier Tuesday the Observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa according to the group which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports. Both towns are under jihadist control though all of Tuesdays casualties there were civilians. Most of Idlibs countryside is out of government control but its capital remains in regime hands. In November Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front expelled Western-backed rebels from their Idlib positions. The provinces countryside was among the first areas the government lost in the nearly four year conflict. The conflict began when forces loyal to President Bashar Al Assad launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-reform protests in March 2011 that triggered a complex multi-sided civil war. It has cost the lives of more than 200000 people and forced half the countrys population to flee their homes.",jordantimes,1/19/2015,hasakeh,1,last updat jan 202015 beirut syrian govern air strike tuesday kill least 39 peopl half civilian two main battleground north countri monitor said syrian observatori human right document death least 27 peopl air strike target outskirt tal hami said britainbas organis speak afp observatori director rami abdel rahman said nine kill identifi group civilian dead may civilian yet abl confirm abdel rahman said ad tal hami situat hasakeh provinc border iraq home sizeabl kurdish popul control islam state jihadist group tuesday bomb especi deadli struck cattl market bodi mutil strike peopl couldnt tell human anim remain said abdel rahman earlier tuesday observatori report string air strike town saraqeb villag sheikh mustafa northwestern provinc idlib eleven civilian kill saraqeb anoth man die sheikh mustafa accord group reli broad network activist doctor report town jihadist control though tuesday casualti civilian idlib countrysid govern control capit remain regim hand novemb al qaeda affili al nusra front expel westernback rebel idlib posit provinc countrysid among first area govern lost nearli four year conflict conflict began forc loyal presid bashar al assad launch brutal crackdown peac proreform protest march 2011 trigger complex multisid civil war cost live 200000 peopl forc half countri popul flee home
1924058053,Syria air strikes kill at least 44 _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Feb 022015 Beirut Syrian government air strikes on opposition-held towns across the country killed at least 44 people on Monday and wounded more than 100 a monitoring group said. In Jassem in the southern province of Daraa 16 civilians were killed in four air strikes while 25 were wounded said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes came in response to a major rebel offensive that has been under way in southern Syria for months. ""As usual the regime is striking populated areas in order to make civilian supporters of opposition fighters turn against them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar Assad have suffered a spate of defeats at the hands of his forces but they still have the upper hand in Daraa. ""Opposition fighters are making steady progress in Daraa province. The vast majority of the west of the province has completely fallen out of government control and that is where Jassem is located"" Abdel Rahman said. Rebels in the area benefit from ""the fact that supply lines from Jordan are still open"" he added. The involvement of experienced fighters from Syrias Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front has also helped the rebels to gain territory in Daraa. Elsewhere air strikes on Douma the besieged rebel-held town east of Damascus killed at least 10 civilians and wounded dozens more the observatory said. An AFP photographer in Douma said the strikes hit residential areas and that most of the wounded were children. Defector killed At Khan Sheikhun in the northwestern province of Idlib 15 people were killed including a former army officer who had defected from loyalist ranks to join opposition forces the observatory said. Another three people were killed in strikes elsewhere in Syria one in Aleppo province a second in Damascus province and a third in Busra Al Sham in Daraa province. The regime first deployed warplanes in the Syrian conflict in July 2012. Now nearly four years into the war there are air strikes every day despite repeated warnings from the international community that such tactics fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. On a separate front Syrian Kurds fighting the IS group made fresh advances near Kobani seizing a new string of villages a week after the flashpoint town was recaptured from the IS jihadists. The Kurds now control an area stretching across 14 kilometres southwards from Kobani 10 kilometres to the east and 10 to 12 kilometres to the west said Abdel Rahman. The Observatory director also said Kurdish Peoples Protection Units backed by Syrian rebels had killed 10 IS members in the past 24 hours. The US-led coalition targeting the jihadists in both Syria and Iraq reported Monday it had launched 10 air strikes against IS in Syria nine near Kobani and one at Deir Ezzor in the east. Another 17 strikes targeted the jihadists in neighbouring Iraq the Pentagon said. The Syrian conflict began as a peaceful uprising in March 2011 but escalated into a civil war after the government unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent.

1924058055,Syria regime air strikes kill 15 near Damascus _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Feb 092015 BEIRUT At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded on Monday in government air strikes on an area outside the capital Damascus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. There were no immediate details on the breakdown of those killed in the strikes which are the latest to hit the town of Douma in the rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta. At a field clinic in the area an AFP photographer saw a girl in a purple headscarf and another child in a woolly hat crying as doctors treated the wounded among them a young boy. His eyes stared wide in apparent shock from a face streaked with blood and white dust. His arm was bandaged and attached to a rudimentary drip. In the streets outside locals picked through rubble carrying the wounded to the clinic while a civil defence worker trained a hose on a fire set by the strikes. The opposition bastion east of Damascus was still reeling from a massive government aerial assault on Thursday that came after rebels fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds into the capital. The rebel barrage killed 10 people in Damascus including a child while the government air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles fired at Eastern Ghouta killed at least 82 people among them 18 children. Eastern Ghouta has been under government siege for nearly two years as the army tries to break the rebel hold over the area. The siege has created medical and food shortages exacerbating dire humanitarian needs created by regular government bombardment of the area.

1924058056,Massive Daesh bomb attack kills 44 in Syrian Kurdish city | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 282016 A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,jordantimes,7/22/2016,hasakeh,0,last updat jul 282016 massiv bomb blast claim daesh terror group kill least 44 peopl wound dozen wednesday kurdishmajor syrian citi qamishli largest deadliest attack hit citi sinc begin syria conflict march 2011 syrian state media gave toll 44 dead 140 injur bomb hit western district citi sever local kurdish ministri locat britainbas syrian observatori human right monitor gave toll 48 dead ad children women among kill kurdish offici said attack carri suicid bomber drive explosivesladen truck ad blast deton nearbi fuel contain afp journalist saw devast scene bomb aftermath distraught civilian cover blood stagger rubbl past twist metal burnedout remain car one man run along street complet cover blood shirt drench red grip arm small boy whose face grey red blood dust ran past hyster woman cri scream cloth torn girl boy stood next appar shock children could heard scream smoke rose small fire continu burn amongst rubbl civilian local secur forc gun slung across back work carri dead wound remain damag destroy build us probe civilian casualti daesh claim attack statement circul social media call respons crime commit crusad coalit aircraft town manbij bastion extremist group syria aleppo provinc kurdish fighter key forc battl extremist north northeastern syria main compon syrian democrat forc allianc current seek oust daesh manbij back air strike launch usl coalit fight daesh syria iraq spokesman coalit said wednesday open formal investig determin whether strike near manbij last week kill civilian observatori report 56 civilian kill strike fled villag near manbij juli 19 colonel chri garver said suffici credibl evid civilian victim warrant probe qamishli share control syrian regim kurdish author declar zone autonom administr across part north northeast syria regularli target bomb attack mani claim daesh sourc kurdish asayesh secur forc told afp largest explos citi ever seen area target hous sever kurdish administr build includ defenc ministri consid secur zone multipl checkpoint secur measur place blast biggest qamishli term toll damag sinc begin war observatori director rami abdel rahman said local offici said hospit citi swamp casualti attack syrian state televis carri appeal governor hasakeh provinc qamishli locat urg resid go public privat hospit donat blood victim terrorist bomb 280000 peopl kill syria sinc war began antigovern protest met regim crackdown aleppo citi least 18 peopl kill govern air strike artilleri fire wednesday rebelheld neighbourhood east citi observatori said syrian armi meanwhil offici announc sever suppli rout cross use terrorist bring mercenari weapon ammunit eastern neighbourhood aleppo oppositionheld east effect sieg sinc juli 7 govern forc advanc within fire rang sole remain rout aleppo countri econom powerhous ravag war divid roughli govern control west rebel control east sinc mid2012
1924058058,At least 70 killed in north of Syrias Aleppo monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas.

1924058059,Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jun 182016 BEIRUT At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.,jordantimes,6/15/2016,aleppo,1,last updat jun 182016 beirut least seven peopl die rebel shell neighbourhood syrian citi aleppo held kurdish ypg militia dawn saturday monitor group said rebel took territori south 40 peopl also wound attack sheikh maqsoud area britainbas syrian observatori human right said district next way rebelheld part northern citi castello road escal air artilleri strike recent week around road made virtual impass put hundr thousand peopl aleppo effect sieg hundr peopl kill aleppo sinc peac talk broke april syria presid bashar assad seek regain control syria largest prewar citi split rebel govern sector rebel said past attack sheikh maqsoud respons ypg attempt cut castello road ypg control nearli syria northern frontier turkey close alli unit state campaign daesh syria mani rebel western syria trust ypg say cooper damascu rather fight accus ypg deni heavi bombard sheikh maqsoud intens bombard sinc midfebruari kill 132 civilian injur around 900 observatori said 48hour ceasefir aleppo announc russia thursday littl impact fight air strike shell continu around citi sinc three peopl two children die nine peopl injur barrel bomb drop helicopt citi observatori said saturday white helmet group civil defenc emerg worker oper rebelheld area said twitter one build haritan north aleppo countrysid hit air strike saturday injuri observatori also said saturday rebel captur three villag south aleppo govern control zeitan khalsa barna caus signific loss among govern forc alli villag near main highway within rebel territori link aleppo capit damascu south lie area captur govern forc end last year larg offens assist iranianback militia russian airpow syrian observatori said lack russian air support week battl villag least 86 member syrian govern forc alli includ member lebanes group hizbollah iranianback militia kill fight south aleppo area past four day observatori said number could independ confirm rebel fight alongsid al qaedaaffili al nusra front like daesh terror group exclud februari ceasefir geneva peac talk
1924058060,Raids on Syria market kill 21 hundreds flee Daesh bastion | Jordan Times,Last updated at Jun 132016 In this photo taken on June 8 provided by the Syrian Civil Defence Directorate in Liberated Province of Aleppo which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting shows Syrian civil defence workers (right) help an injured woman after warplanes attacked a street in Aleppo Syria (AP photo) BEIRUT Air strikes on a market in Syrias Al Qaeda-held city of Idlib killed at least 21 civilians Sunday as hundreds fled a besieged Daesh bastion near the Turkish border. Five children were among those killed in the air raids on Idlib which is held by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front and its allies the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Peace talks towards ending Syrias five-year war have stalled with no immediate end in sight to a conflict that has killed 280000 people. It was not clear who carried out the Idlib strikes but the observatory has reported previous air raids by the regime and its Russian ally on Idlib province which is also controlled by Al Nusra and rebel allies. Footage the observatory said was filmed after the Idlib strikes showed emergency workers training water hoses on a tall building amid a haze of smoke. In Maaret Al Numan an area south of the provincial capital unidentified warplanes also killed at least six civilians including a woman and her four children the observatory said. Russia launched air strikes in support of the Damascus regime in September allowing forces loyal to President Bashar Assad to advance against the rebels and Daesh. The Britain-based observatory relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria for its information. It says it determines what aircraft carried out raids based on their location flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. The observatory said Russian air strikes killed 23 civilians in strikes on Idlib city on May 31 but Russia denied carrying out raids there that day. Suspected government strikes killed at least 37 civilians in Maaret Al Numan in April sparking condemnation from Syrias opposition amid faltering peace talks Civilians flee Daesh bastion Meanwhile hundreds of civilians escaped the Daesh stronghold of Manbij in nearby Aleppo province on Sunday helped by a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance surrounding the town. Tens of thousands had been trapped inside Manbij after the alliance encircled the town on Friday in a major blow to the terrorist group controlling it. Around 600 civilians fled on foot towards areas held by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance south of the town observatory Chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The SDF transported them to safer areas. Those still inside the town were terrified by heavy air strikes in the area Abdel Rahman said and food was becoming scarce after the SDF alliance blocked all roads in and out. At least 223 Daesh fighters and 28 SDF troops had been killed as well as 41 civilians in coalition air raids since the alliance offensive against Manbij began on May 31 according to the Observatory. Manbij lies at the heart of the last stretch of Daesh-controlled territory along Turkeys border. The siege has severed a key Daesh supply route that had channelled money and weapons from the Turkish border to the groups de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city. Daesh has come under attack on several fronts since declaring a cross-border caliphate in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Millions of people have been displaced since Syrias civil war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Peace talks hit deadlock after the opposition walked out of negotiations in April over the escalating violence and lack of humanitarian access.,jordantimes,6/22/2016,idlib,1,last updat jun 132016 photo taken june 8 provid syrian civil defenc director liber provinc aleppo authent base content ap report show syrian civil defenc worker right help injur woman warplan attack street aleppo syria ap photo beirut air strike market syria al qaedaheld citi idlib kill least 21 civilian sunday hundr fled besieg daesh bastion near turkish border five children among kill air raid idlib held al qaeda affili al nusra front alli syrian observatori human right said peac talk toward end syria fiveyear war stall immedi end sight conflict kill 280000 peopl clear carri idlib strike observatori report previou air raid regim russian alli idlib provinc also control al nusra rebel alli footag observatori said film idlib strike show emerg worker train water hose tall build amid haze smoke maaret al numan area south provinci capit unidentifi warplan also kill least six civilian includ woman four children observatori said russia launch air strike support damascu regim septemb allow forc loyal presid bashar assad advanc rebel daesh britainbas observatori reli wide network sourc insid syria inform say determin aircraft carri raid base locat flight pattern type plane munit involv observatori said russian air strike kill 23 civilian strike idlib citi may 31 russia deni carri raid day suspect govern strike kill least 37 civilian maaret al numan april spark condemn syria opposit amid falter peac talk civilian flee daesh bastion meanwhil hundr civilian escap daesh stronghold manbij nearbi aleppo provinc sunday help usback kurdisharab allianc surround town ten thousand trap insid manbij allianc encircl town friday major blow terrorist group control around 600 civilian fled foot toward area held syrian democrat forc allianc south town observatori chief rami abdel rahman said sdf transport safer area still insid town terrifi heavi air strike area abdel rahman said food becom scarc sdf allianc block road least 223 daesh fighter 28 sdf troop kill well 41 civilian coalit air raid sinc allianc offens manbij began may 31 accord observatori manbij lie heart last stretch daeshcontrol territori along turkey border sieg sever key daesh suppli rout channel money weapon turkish border group de facto syrian capit raqqa citi daesh come attack sever front sinc declar crossbord caliph syria iraq 2014 million peopl displac sinc syria civil war start 2011 brutal repress antigovern protest peac talk hit deadlock opposit walk negoti april escal violenc lack humanitarian access
1924058061,_28 dead in Daesh counterattack on Syria regime forces_ | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jun 142016 BEIRUT A Daesh counterattack on Syrian regime forces advancing towards a militant stronghold on Monday left 28 militants dead a monitor said. Dozens of Daesh militants early on Monday attacked government positions south of the town of Tabaqa a Daesh stronghold on the Euphrates River said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said fierce clashes broke out but that regime forces were able to maintain their positions and were still 15 kilometres from the Daesh-held Tabaqa airport. ""Eleven regime fighters and 17 Daesh fighters were killed in the attack"" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier this month government fighters backed by Russian air power began pushing north towards Tabaqa held by Daesh since 2014. The town lies some 50 kilometres east of the extremist groups Syrian de facto capital of Raqqa city and recapturing it would sever the supply road from the west. Last week Daesh militants had sent reinforcements of fighters and weapons into Tabaqa in anticipation of a fierce battle to defend the town. Abdel Rahman said a total of 37 government fighters and 101 Daesh militants have been killed since the regime launched its offensive for Tabaqa. The war in Syria which began with the brutal repression of anti-government demonstrations in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions.

1924058063,Syrian and Russian aircraft step up bombing of Aleppo city _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jun 062016 AMMAN Nearly 50 air strikes hit rebel-held areas in and around the Syrian city of Aleppo on Sunday in some of the heaviest recent raids by Russian and Syrian government aircraft residents and a monitoring group said. The group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said an unidentified war plane had crashed in countryside south of Aleppo in an area where Islamist rebel fighters are battling the Syrian army and Iranian-backed forces. It had no information on what caused the crash. A civil defence worker said at least 32 people were killed in the rebel-held parts of the city during the air strikes with 18 bodies pulled from flattened buildings in the Qatrji neighbourhood the worst hit. The monitor said dozens of barrel bombs oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel were dropped by helicopter on densely populated districts. ""This week-long campaign of bombing is very intense and day by day its getting worse... it is the worst we have seen in a while"" said Bebars Mishal a civil defence official in rebel-held Aleppo. For their part rebels hit government-held areas of Aleppo in what Syrian media said was an escalation of mortar attacks on the western districts. State media said attacks on Sunday on Hamadaniyah Midan and other neighbourhoods by insurgents killed at least 20 people in the second day of intense shelling of government-held areas. The death toll over the whole weekend was at least 44. Aleppo the countrys largest city before the war has been divided for years between rebel and government-held zones. Full control of Aleppo would be a huge prize for President Bashar Assad. Russias military intervention since September has helped to bolster Assads government. In the northwestern province of Idlib meanwhile residents said Syrian and Russian jets bombed the rebel-held provincial capital setting fire to a bustling market in the heart of the city. More than 30 people were injured at least three killed and dozens were unaccounted for according to an activist contacted in the city. The Idlib strikes came just days after some of the heaviest raids on residential areas for months killing more than 30 people and injuring dozens on May 31. Idlib has been a relative haven for thousands of displaced Syrians. The air raids in Aleppo on Sunday came in the wake of strikes on civilian areas on Friday that residents said were the most intense in over a month. The Syrian Observatory said the Syrian government raids had targeted the main Castello road that leads into rebel-held Aleppo as part of a campaign to complete the encirclement of the citys insurgent-dominated areas. A Russian defence ministry statement on Sunday accused militant Syrian rebel groups of firing mortars on the mainly Kurdish-populated Sheikh Maqsood neighbourhood in Aleppo that overlooks the Castello road. The monitor said 13 people including six children were killed on Saturday in the Kurdish-run area by insurgents mortars. Rebels accuse the powerful Kurdish YPG of working with the Syrian army to cut the main artery by intensifying their ground attacks on the highway. The Russians had on Saturday accused militants from radical Islamic groups of bringing at least 1000 fighters into an area in the southern Aleppo countryside. The militants have consolidated gains since Friday in the area around the strategic town of Khan Touman rebels say. The Nusra Front spearheaded an attack on Khan Touman last month delivering one of the biggest battlefield setbacks yet to a coalition of foreign Shiite fighters supporting Syrian government forces. Rebels say Russian jets on Sunday pounded insurgent positions in the area to prevent them from advancing towards the nearby town of Hader which rebels say is a stronghold of Iranian-backed militias. Also US-backed forces on Sunday engaged with the Daesh terror groups militants in an offensive that began last Tuesday against the group-held areas in Aleppo province beginning with the Manbij area where they continued to seize more villages according to Kurdish sources and the monitor.",jordantimes,6/22/2016,aleppo,1,last updat jun 062016 amman nearli 50 air strike hit rebelheld area around syrian citi aleppo sunday heaviest recent raid russian syrian govern aircraft resid monitor group said group syrian observatori human right also said unidentifi war plane crash countrysid south aleppo area islamist rebel fighter battl syrian armi iranianback forc inform caus crash civil defenc worker said least 32 peopl kill rebelheld part citi air strike 18 bodi pull flatten build qatrji neighbourhood worst hit monitor said dozen barrel bomb oil drum cylind pack explos shrapnel drop helicopt dens popul district weeklong campaign bomb intens day day get wors worst seen said bebar mishal civil defenc offici rebelheld aleppo part rebel hit governmentheld area aleppo syrian media said escal mortar attack western district state media said attack sunday hamadaniyah midan neighbourhood insurg kill least 20 peopl second day intens shell governmentheld area death toll whole weekend least 44 aleppo countri largest citi war divid year rebel governmentheld zone full control aleppo would huge prize presid bashar assad russia militari intervent sinc septemb help bolster assad govern northwestern provinc idlib meanwhil resid said syrian russian jet bomb rebelheld provinci capit set fire bustl market heart citi 30 peopl injur least three kill dozen unaccount accord activist contact citi idlib strike came day heaviest raid residenti area month kill 30 peopl injur dozen may 31 idlib rel thousand displac syrian air raid aleppo sunday came wake strike civilian area friday resid said intens month syrian observatori said syrian govern raid target main castello road lead rebelheld aleppo part campaign complet encircl citi insurgentdomin area russian defenc ministri statement sunday accus milit syrian rebel group fire mortar mainli kurdishpopul sheikh maqsood neighbourhood aleppo overlook castello road monitor said 13 peopl includ six children kill saturday kurdishrun area insurg mortar rebel accus power kurdish ypg work syrian armi cut main arteri intensifi ground attack highway russian saturday accus milit radic islam group bring least 1000 fighter area southern aleppo countrysid milit consolid gain sinc friday area around strateg town khan touman rebel say nusra front spearhead attack khan touman last month deliv one biggest battlefield setback yet coalit foreign shiit fighter support syrian govern forc rebel say russian jet sunday pound insurg posit area prevent advanc toward nearbi town hader rebel say stronghold iranianback militia also usback forc sunday engag daesh terror group milit offens began last tuesday groupheld area aleppo provinc begin manbij area continu seiz villag accord kurdish sourc monitor
1924058064,Syria air strikes kill 22 mostly children outside school | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 262016 BEIRUT Air strikes in Syria killed up to 22 people mostly children on Wednesday when warplanes struck a residential area housing a school complex in the northern rebel-held province of Idlib activists and rescue workers said. A team of first responders the Syrian Civil Defence in Idlib said 22 people were killed and at least 50 wounded in the raids on the village of Hass. Most of those killed were children the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave the same death toll and said 14 children and a woman were among those killed. The activist-operated Idlib News network which gave a lower toll of 17 people killed said the strikes hit as the children were gathered outside the school complex. It said the death toll could rise as some of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition the network added. Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold though radical groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the US-led coalition targeting Daesh militants. Footage posted by activists online shows a huge plume of smoke rising from the area of the strikes and rescuers rushing casualties away along a dusty road lined with destroyed buildings. A womans body is seen being carried on a stretcher while other bodies covered in cloth and one with only a hat lie under shrubs and other casualties are ferried away in pick-up trucks. An activist at the scene Muaz Al Shami said as many as 10 air strikes were believed to have hit the residential area. The video content couldnt be independently confirmed. However it conforms with AP reporting on the events depicted. Earlier in the day the northern Aleppo province saw a new escalation as a helicopter believed to belong to Syrian government forces dropped barrel bombs in a deadly attack on Turkey-backed opposition forces in the border area Turkish officials said. A statement attributed to the field commander of Syrias pro-government troops said any Turkish advances in northern Syria under the pretext of fighting Daesh militants would be dealt with forcefully and appropriately. The barrel bombing was said to have occurred in the village of Tal Madiq in a part of northern Aleppo where rival groups have been operating mostly to rout Daesh militants. If confirmed it would be the first attack by Syrian government forces on the Turkish-backed fighters. Turkeys state-run news agency didnt say when the attack occurred and said at least two Syrian opposition fighters were killed and five others wounded. A Syrian opposition spokesman said it took place Tuesday. The observatorys chief Rami Abdurrahman said helicopters struck as intense clashes were underway between Kurdish-led fighters and Turkey-backed forces in Tal Madiq and that 11 Syrian opposition fighters and five Kurdish fighters were killed. The Kurdish-led forces are now in control of the village about 16 kilometres from the highly prized Daesh-controlled town of Al Bab. A senior Kurdish commander however denied Syrian government bombings of the Turkey-backed fighters saying it was an attempted explanation for battlefield losses. They are trying to find a pretext for the loss. No aircraft were involved Mahmoud Barkhadan of the main Syria Kurdish militia the Peoples Protection Units told The Associated Press by telephone from the region. A spokesman for the Syrian fighting group Nour El Din El Zinki Yasser Al Youssef said the Kurdish-led forces attacked them while they were fighting Daesh militants in the area. Then Syrian government helicopters followed he said in a message. The complex terrain is a powder keg where confrontation among rival groups can break out anytime US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey. Ankara sent tanks troops and aircraft into northern Syria in August in an unprecedented incursion that it said was part of efforts to help Syrian opposition clear the border area of Daesh militants. But Ankara is also seeking to contain the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Daesh putting it at odds with its key ally the United States. Ankara sees Kurdish fighters in Syria as an extension of its outlawed Kurdish militants and designated as a terrorist organisation. Syrias military threatened last week to shoot down any Turkish warplane that enters Syrian air space after Turkish jets raided villages in northern Syria in an escalation of Ankaras offensive against Kurdish fighters. On Wednesday a statement attributed to the field commander of pro-government troops said Turkish advance under the pretext of fighting Daesh in northern and eastern Aleppo is an encroachment on the Syrian governments area of operations and would not be tolerated. The fall of Al Bab to Turkey-backed rebels would threaten the governments siege on the rebels in the city of Aleppo to the west. Meanwhile Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that Turkey is determined to push ahead with the offensive in northern Syria dubbed Operation Eurphrates Shield and capture Al Bab from Daesh militants. It would not be deterred by the bombing of Tal Madiq he said. Such attacks will not stop us from combatting Daesh Cavusoglu said. The Euphrates Shield operation will continue. The only goal of the Euphrates Shield operation is to clear Daesh from this area.,jordantimes,10/7/2016,idlib,1,last updat oct 262016 beirut air strike syria kill 22 peopl mostli children wednesday warplan struck residenti area hous school complex northern rebelheld provinc idlib activist rescu worker said team first respond syrian civil defenc idlib said 22 peopl kill least 50 wound raid villag hass kill children group said post facebook page anoth activist group britainbas syrian observatori human right gave death toll said 14 children woman among kill activistoper idlib news network gave lower toll 17 peopl kill said strike hit children gather outsid school complex said death toll could rise wound report critic condit network ad idlib main syrian opposit stronghold though radic group also larg presenc regularli hit syrian russian warplan well usl coalit target daesh milit footag post activist onlin show huge plume smoke rise area strike rescuer rush casualti away along dusti road line destroy build woman bodi seen carri stretcher bodi cover cloth one hat lie shrub casualti ferri away pickup truck activist scene muaz al shami said mani 10 air strike believ hit residenti area video content couldnt independ confirm howev conform ap report event depict earlier day northern aleppo provinc saw new escal helicopt believ belong syrian govern forc drop barrel bomb deadli attack turkeyback opposit forc border area turkish offici said statement attribut field command syria progovern troop said turkish advanc northern syria pretext fight daesh milit would dealt forc appropri barrel bomb said occur villag tal madiq part northern aleppo rival group oper mostli rout daesh milit confirm would first attack syrian govern forc turkishback fighter turkey staterun news agenc didnt say attack occur said least two syrian opposit fighter kill five other wound syrian opposit spokesman said took place tuesday observatori chief rami abdurrahman said helicopt struck intens clash underway kurdishl fighter turkeyback forc tal madiq 11 syrian opposit fighter five kurdish fighter kill kurdishl forc control villag 16 kilometr highli prize daeshcontrol town al bab senior kurdish command howev deni syrian govern bomb turkeyback fighter say attempt explan battlefield loss tri find pretext loss aircraft involv mahmoud barkhadan main syria kurdish militia peopl protect unit told associ press telephon region spokesman syrian fight group nour el din el zinki yasser al youssef said kurdishl forc attack fight daesh milit area syrian govern helicopt follow said messag complex terrain powder keg confront among rival group break anytim usback syrian kurdish fighter turkeyback syrian rebel turkey ankara sent tank troop aircraft northern syria august unpreced incurs said part effort help syrian opposit clear border area daesh milit ankara also seek contain usback syrian kurdish forc fight daesh put odd key alli unit state ankara see kurdish fighter syria extens outlaw kurdish milit design terrorist organis syria militari threaten last week shoot turkish warplan enter syrian air space turkish jet raid villag northern syria escal ankara offens kurdish fighter wednesday statement attribut field command progovern troop said turkish advanc pretext fight daesh northern eastern aleppo encroach syrian govern area oper would toler fall al bab turkeyback rebel would threaten govern sieg rebel citi aleppo west meanwhil turkish foreign minist mevlut cavusoglu told report turkey determin push ahead offens northern syria dub oper eurphrat shield captur al bab daesh milit would deter bomb tal madiq said attack stop us combat daesh cavusoglu said euphrat shield oper continu goal euphrat shield oper clear daesh area
1924058065,Syrian government push for Damascus rebel enclave kills at least 23 | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 272017 BEIRUT An intensifying push by the Syrian government and allied forces to take the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus killed at least 23 people on Sunday and injured many the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said at least 127 people including 30 children have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army backed by Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Eastern Ghouta is one of several ""de-escalation"" zones across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and President Bashar Assads government. A Reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of Mesraba and Harasta. Heavy shelling also hit Eastern Ghouta and dozens had been injured. Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis. Ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days the UN World Food Programme said in a report this week. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. A number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government-held Damascus in the past two weeks. Syrias six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War II. UN-backed peace negotiations are due to begin in Geneva on November 28. Several previous rounds of Geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for Syria or a way to stop the violence. Yahya Aridi spokesman for the Syrian opposition Geneva delegation said on Sunday it was now time for the Syrian government and the opposition to ""get to the table and start talking about transition from dictatorship to freedom"" in Geneva.",jordantimes,11/16/2017,damascus,1,last updat nov 272017 beirut intensifi push syrian govern alli forc take last major rebel stronghold near capit damascu kill least 23 peopl sunday injur mani syrian observatori human right said group said least 127 peopl includ 30 children kill air strike shell sinc syrian armi back russian jet began offens nearli two week ago take besieg rebelheld eastern ghouta area eastern ghouta one sever deescal zone across western syria russia broker deal eas fight rebel presid bashar assad govern reuter wit said drone sky sinc sunday morn warplan heavili bombard town mesraba harasta heavi shell also hit eastern ghouta dozen injur assad forc besieg eastern ghouta sinc 2012 area suffer humanitarian crisi ghouta resid short food eat trash faint hunger forc children eat altern day un world food programm said report week opposit eastern ghouta damascu countrysid local council said week escal bombard forc peopl seek shelter unsuit unsanitari place fear could lead diseas outbreak number shell rebel enclav hit governmentheld damascu past two week syria sixyearold civil war kill hundr thousand peopl forc million flee worst refuge crisi sinc world war ii unback peac negoti due begin geneva novemb 28 sever previou round geneva talk fail agre polit transit syria way stop violenc yahya aridi spokesman syrian opposit geneva deleg said sunday time syrian govern opposit get tabl start talk transit dictatorship freedom geneva
1924058066,Air strikes kill 4 in Syria _truce zone_ _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Nov 022017 BEIRUT Syrian government air strikes killed at least four civilians including a child in a rebel-held town in a de-escalation zone outside the capital Damascus on Thursday a monitor said. The strikes hit the town of Douma which lies in the Eastern Ghouta region where a truce deal agreed by regime allies Iran and Russia and rebel backer Turkey has been in place since July. Despite the deal there has been an uptick in government bombardment of the area in recent days. Humanitarian groups have also warned of a malnutrition crisis in the area which is under a tight government siege. Regime planes fired rockets on several parts of Douma said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor. Four civilians were killed including a child he said adding that 21 others were wounded. An AFP photographer saw some of the wounded being treated at a local medical facility where some of the dead were also being received.

The plane came back a second time and I tried to get down to the basement but the force of the second strike knocked the door closed and it injured my head and nose. Up to 400000 people are believed to live in Eastern Ghouta which has been under government siege since 2013. The blockade has caused serious food and medicine shortages and pushed the prices for what remains beyond the reach of impoverished residents. At least two children are reported to have died from malnourishment or related complications in recent weeks and more than 1100 other children are reportedly suffering acute malnutrition. On Monday several dozen trucks carrying assistance for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta as part of a United Nations-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy. It was the first aid access since September despite repeated requests from the UN and humanitarian actors for consistent access to besieged areas like Eastern Ghouta. On Tuesday 11 people including six school children were killed in regime shelling on the town of Jisreen in Eastern Ghouta the observatory said. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.,jordantimes,11/2/2017,damascus,1,last updat nov 022017 beirut syrian govern air strike kill least four civilian includ child rebelheld town deescal zone outsid capit damascu thursday monitor said strike hit town douma lie eastern ghouta region truce deal agre regim alli iran russia rebel backer turkey place sinc juli despit deal uptick govern bombard area recent day humanitarian group also warn malnutrit crisi area tight govern sieg regim plane fire rocket sever part douma said rami abdel rahman director syrian observatori human right britainbas monitor four civilian kill includ child said ad 21 other wound afp photograph saw wound treat local medic facil dead also receiv ziad 13 suffer head injuri caught strike way home come back school first strike hit hid doorway told afp plane came back second time tri get basement forc second strike knock door close injur head nose 400000 peopl believ live eastern ghouta govern sieg sinc 2013 blockad caus seriou food medicin shortag push price remain beyond reach impoverish resid least two children report die malnourish relat complic recent week 1100 children reportedli suffer acut malnutrit monday sever dozen truck carri assist 40000 peopl enter eastern ghouta part unit nationssyrian arab red crescent convoy first aid access sinc septemb despit repeat request un humanitarian actor consist access besieg area like eastern ghouta tuesday 11 peopl includ six school children kill regim shell town jisreen eastern ghouta observatori said 330000 peopl kill syria sinc conflict began march 2011 antigovern protest
1924058067,Syria regime bombardment kills 4 schoolchildren in besieged enclave | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 012017 JISREEN Syria At least four schoolchildren were among eight people killed in Syrian regime shelling in Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday despite a ceasefire in the hunger-hit rebel enclave outside Damascus. The bombardment came as a fresh round of peace talks to end Syrias six-year war entered a second day in the Kazakh capital Astana. Government fire on the besieged region has been on the rise for the past week with the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor saying the latest shelling hit a school in the town of Jisreen. ""A shell fired by regime troops hit the entrance of a school in Jisreen just as children were leaving it killing five people including four schoolchildren"" observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. A medical source at the town hospital confirmed the death toll and said another 25 people were wounded. An AFP photographer at the medical facility saw the bodies of four children wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds. Several wounded children lay or sat in shock on hospital beds including one with severed legs. A man cried out after learning his son had died as others around him tried to comfort him. Blood-stained satchels Small blue school bags and a tiny pair of shoes lay in a corner drenched in blood. Outside the primary school children stared at the pools of blood staining the concrete ground. ""I was coming out of school and was about to turn into a side street when the shell hit. There were dead people wounded people"" one child told AFP. The observatory said regime bombardment on Tuesday also hit other areas of Eastern Ghouta where opposition fighters have been battling President Bashar Assads troops for six years. The regime on July 22 announced a ceasefire with rebels in the besieged area which has been included in a so-called de-escalation zone agreed by Turkey Russia and Iran. On Tuesday regime shelling on the Mesraba area also in Eastern Ghouta killed three civilians including one child the observatory said. An AFP journalist at a morgue saw rescue volunteers and young men slip the bodies of a father and his son into white plastic bags. May God avenge oppressors the mans brother cried. In the town of Harasta shelling also hit near a school as pupils were leaving it wounding 10 people including five children. On Sunday 11 civilians including a journalist for pro-opposition television were killed in Eastern Ghouta. Malnutrition The shelling comes as Eastern Ghouta where an estimated 400000 people live faces a mounting humanitarian crisis. Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa. They face twin offensives in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor from the regime and the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.",jordantimes,11/2/2017,damascus,1,last updat nov 012017 jisreen syria least four schoolchildren among eight peopl kill syrian regim shell eastern ghouta tuesday despit ceasefir hungerhit rebel enclav outsid damascu bombard came fresh round peac talk end syria sixyear war enter second day kazakh capit astana govern fire besieg region rise past week britainbas syrian observatori human right monitor say latest shell hit school town jisreen shell fire regim troop hit entranc school jisreen children leav kill five peopl includ four schoolchildren observatori chief rami abdel rahman said medic sourc town hospit confirm death toll said anoth 25 peopl wound afp photograph medic facil saw bodi four children wrap bloodstain white shroud sever wound children lay sat shock hospit bed includ one sever leg man cri learn son die other around tri comfort bloodstain satchel small blue school bag tini pair shoe lay corner drench blood outsid primari school children stare pool blood stain concret ground come school turn side street shell hit dead peopl wound peopl one child told afp observatori said regim bombard tuesday also hit area eastern ghouta opposit fighter battl presid bashar assad troop six year regim juli 22 announc ceasefir rebel besieg area includ socal deescal zone agre turkey russia iran tuesday regim shell mesraba area also eastern ghouta kill three civilian includ one child observatori said afp journalist morgu saw rescu volunt young men slip bodi father son white plastic bag may god aveng oppressor man brother cri town harasta shell also hit near school pupil leav wound 10 peopl includ five children sunday 11 civilian includ journalist proopposit televis kill eastern ghouta malnutrit shell come eastern ghouta estim 400000 peopl live face mount humanitarian crisi shock recent afp imag region show sever underweight children doctor report two infant die malnutrit relat complic monday dozen truck carri aid 40000 peopl enter eastern ghouta region prime agricultur region fame orchard rebel stronghold tight govern sieg sinc 2013 caus shortag food medicin well price hike local smuggl suppli avail basic servic virtual nonexist electr produc gener water often dirti vector diseas 330000 peopl kill syria sinc war began march 2011 antigovern protest conflict sinc spiral complex war involv world power daesh terror group extremist took larg swath countri 2014 extremist sinc lost territori control oust two week ago de facto syrian capit raqqa face twin offens eastern oilrich provinc deir ezzor regim usback kurdisharab syrian democrat forc
1924058068,Russian strike kills 38 fleeing civilians in east Syria _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 042017 BEIRUT A Russian air strike killed 38 civilians on Wednesday as they tried to cross the Euphrates River to escape fighting in eastern Syrias Deir Ezzor province a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain said nine children were among those killed as they tried to cross the river aboard rafts escaping from areas where Russian-backed regime forces are battling the Daesh terror group. The monitor which earlier gave a toll of 20 in the strikes said the dead included an Iraqi family. Deir Ezzor borders Iraq and civilians have fled into the province to escape the battles against Daesh in their own country. Two campaigns are being fought against Daesh in east Deir Ezzor with one on the western side of the Euphrates river that slices diagonally across the province led by Syrian troops and backed by ally Russia. The second is being fought by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters on the eastern bank of the river. The observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against Daesh in Deir Ezzor and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former extremist bastion Raqqa city. On Tuesday the observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. The coalition says it takes all measures possible to avoid civilian casualties and that it investigates each credible allegation. Last month it acknowledged the deaths of over 700 civilians in its strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes since its intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. The deaths in Deir Ezzor on Wednesday prompted outrage from the opposition Syrian National Coalition which described the incident as a heinous crime. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.,jordantimes,10/22/2017,deir ezzor,0,last updat oct 042017 beirut russian air strike kill 38 civilian wednesday tri cross euphrat river escap fight eastern syria deir ezzor provinc monitor said syrian observatori human right base britain said nine children among kill tri cross river aboard raft escap area russianback regim forc battl daesh terror group monitor earlier gave toll 20 strike said dead includ iraqi famili deir ezzor border iraq civilian fled provinc escap battl daesh countri two campaign fought daesh east deir ezzor one western side euphrat river slice diagon across provinc led syrian troop back alli russia second fought usback syrian democrat forc allianc kurdish arab fighter eastern bank river observatori reli network sourc insid syria say determin whose plane carri raid accord type locat flight pattern munit use group report hundr civilian kill oper daesh deir ezzor neighbour raqqa provinc sdf fight us support captur former extremist bastion raqqa citi tuesday observatori said usl coalit strike raqqa kill least 18 civilian coalit say take measur possibl avoid civilian casualti investig credibl alleg last month acknowledg death 700 civilian strike syria iraq sinc 2014 russia acknowledg civilian death strike sinc interven syria war 2015 dismiss observatori report bias death deir ezzor wednesday prompt outrag opposit syrian nation coalit describ incid heinou crime 330000 peopl kill syria sinc conflict began march 2011 antigovern protest
1924058069,US-led strike kills 18 civilians in Syria_s Raqqa _ monitor | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 032017 BEIRUT A US-led coalition air strike killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in the Daesh extremist groups former stronghold of Raqqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. International coalition planes targeted water wells where a group of civilians were gathered in the north of Raqqa city killing at least 18 civilians observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 per cent of the city from Daesh. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure. He said rigorous standards were applied to coalition targeting and extraordinary efforts taken to avoid civilian deaths. The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well he added in an e-mail to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher. Raqqa has faced water shortages for months because of damage to pipelines caused by suspected coalition strikes. Even in the early days of the Raqqa assault residents said they feared being caught in air strikes or shelling when they ventured to wells or the Euphrates River that runs south of the city to draw water.,jordantimes,10/5/2017,raqqa,0,last updat oct 032017 beirut usl coalit air strike kill least 18 civilian tuesday daesh extremist group former stronghold raqqa syrian observatori human right monitor said intern coalit plane target water well group civilian gather north raqqa citi kill least 18 civilian observatori director rami abdel rahman said britainbas group said four children among dead usback syrian democrat forc allianc kurdish arab fighter broke raqqa june sinc wrest 90 per cent citi daesh activist say coalit strike support oper kill hundr civilian caus enorm damag coalit spokesman colonel ryan dillon said everyth within power limit harm noncombat civilian infrastructur said rigor standard appli coalit target extraordinari effort taken avoid civilian death coalit conduct detail assess everi alleg possibl civilian casualti alleg well ad email afp late septemb coalit acknowledg death 735 civilian strike syria iraq sinc 2014 activist say toll much higher raqqa face water shortag month damag pipelin caus suspect coalit strike even earli day raqqa assault resid said fear caught air strike shell ventur well euphrat river run south citi draw water
1924058070,Russia says it kills 180 extremists mercenaries in Syria claims Shishani_s death | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar Al Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike. Moscow reported Shishanis death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen the ministry said adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daeshs last bastions in Syria. In another air strike more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union Tunisia and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani Alaa Al Din Al Shishani and Salah Al Din Al Shishani all natives of the Northern Caucasus. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani whose nom de guerre means Omar the Chechen came from the former Soviet state of Georgias Pankisi Gorge region which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights disagreed with Moscows report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids. The observatory said Russian air strikes on Thursday night killed 14 people including three children fleeing across the Euphrates on rafts near Mayadeen. Since it intervened in Syria in 2015 Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes and it dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased.

Still image shows a cloud of black smoke rising from vehicles in the distance in what is said to be Aleppos outskirts Syria April 15 2017. (TRT World and Agencies) A suicide car bomb has hit a convoy of buses carrying civilians out of two besieged Syrian towns killing at least 100 people and wounding several others. The explosion took place at a transit point Rashideen area as thousands of evacuees from the regime-held predominantly Shia towns of Foua and Kefraya waited on Saturday to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the Observatory said. It warned that the death toll was likely to rise given the ""several dozen wounded"" at the blast site. People who were evacuated from the two villages of Kefraya and Foua wait near buses after a stall in an agreement between the opposition and Syrian regime army at Rashideen. (TRT World and Agencies) More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from opposition-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Thousands of evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were also stuck in regime-controlled Ramusa south of Aleppo. The evacuation brokered by regime ally Iran and rebel backer Qatar is set to see more than 30000 people evacuated in two stages. The deal to evacuate the towns was the latest in a string of such agreements touted by the rebels as the best way to end the fighting. The opposition says they have been forced out by the siege and bombardment. More than 400000 people have been killed and millions more displaced since the Syrian conflict erupted with protests against Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad in March 2011.

1924058079,US-led air strikes in Syria kill dozens of civilians,"21 Jul 2016 Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed by US-led air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

1924058080,Two Russian pilots killed in Syria as DAESH downs chopper,"10 Jul 2016 After exhausting all their ammunition the pilots were leaving the scene when their helicopter came under fire from the ground near Palmyra city. Syrian soldiers drive past the Arch of Triumph in the ancient city of Palmyra in April. Two Russian airmen were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city. (TRT World and Agencies) Two Russian pilots were killed in Syria after DAESH shot down a helicopter near Palmyra the Russian military was quoted as saying by local media. The two pilots Riafagat Khabibulin and Yevgeny Dolgin were flying a Syrian Mi-25 helicopter which was downed east of Palmyra city. The Russian pilots were attacking DAESH in the Homs region on Friday on the request of the Syrian government. After using up all of their ammunition the pilots were leaving the area when their chopper came under fire from the ground held by Syrian military troops after DAESH militants breached Syrian forces lines east of Palmyra. ""The turning helicopter was hit by militants gunfire from the ground and crashed in the area controlled by the Syrian government army. The crew died"" the Russian military was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. Video footage released by DAESH affiliated news agency Amaq on Saturday showed a helicopter being shot and crashing to the ground against cries of ""Its fallen God is greatest"". The statement by the Russian defence ministry said that the two Russian pilots were on a test flight in the Homs region with a Syrian Mi-25 helicopter laced with ammunition. The statement further said the Syrian government requested the pilots to carry out strikes against the DAESH militants. Both the pilots have been nominated for Russian state awards. Russian forces entered the conflict at the end of last year backing the forces of Syrian regime. Russia has so far lost at least 12 soldiers in the Syrian war.

1924058081,US jets killed at least 15 civilians in Syria,"29 Jul 2016 The US-led coalition strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilians including children. A picture taken on July 29 2016 shows a close up view of Karaj al-Hajz corridor (C) a passage in rebel-held Aleppo leading towards the Syrian government controlled area of Masharqa neighbourhood. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 15 civilians were killed and many wounded in fresh air strikes by US-led coalition in Syria on Thursday morning. These civilians were targeted in the coalition jets bombardment in the town of Ghandoura said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US Central Command which oversees US military operations in the Middle East said it had ""initiated an assessment following internal operational reporting that a strike today near Manbij Syria may have resulted in civilian casualties."" The strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilian lives including children. US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining ""internal and external information"" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble its efforts to prevent civilian deaths and to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.

1924058084,Syrian Russian air strikes kill 17 in city of Ashara,"7 Jun 2016 Victims include 8 children in the eastern Syrian city of Ashara Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. People inspect the damage at a market in Syria hit by air strikes on June 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air stikes thought to be carried out by Syrian and Russian forces killed at least 17 people including 8 children in a market in the Syrian city of Ashara near the southeast provincial capital Deir al-Zor city on Monday. According to the British-based human rights organisation it is feared the death toll will rise because of the high number of serious injuries. The Syrian regime which has been supported by Russia in aerial strikes across the country since September 2015 began attacking DAESH last week. But the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its warplanes carried out air strikes on the market place. Many civilians who are unable to move in and out of DAESH-held areas face the risk of being killed by constant air strikes. People salvage goods from an aid convoy that was damaged during an air strike in the opposition held area of al-Sakhour district of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) UN says such offensives are successful in making gains on DAESH. They also put millions of people at risk of displacement. The UNS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week that 20000 people have already been displaced as a result of the Kurdish-led offensive in Eastern Aleppos Abu Qalqal and Menbij city sub-districts which are mostly under the control of DAESH. According to Syrian government sources the army captured crossroads to advance to Raqqa in eastern Aleppo and the strategic city Deir al Zour which connects the territory to Iraq. The recent attack which killed civilians in the DAESH controlled territory came shortly after another strike by regime forces. At least 15 civilians were killed in air strikes on Friday in the DAESH-held area of Boulil near Deir al Zour. Men walk near a damaged building in Aleppos opposition held al-Fardous district Syria May 26 2016.

A string of bombings near the shrine in February left 134 people dead most of them civilians according to the Observatory.

(Reuters) Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah cited the threat to Sayeda Zeinab as a principal reason for its intervention in Syrias civil war on the side of Bashar al Assad. The shrine is said to contain the grave of Zeinab a venerated granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammed and is renowned for its glistening golden onion-shaped dome. Daraya bombed after receiving food aid after four years The Syrian regime has been accused of dropping barrel bombs on the rebel-held town of Daraya on Friday hours after it received its first shipment of food aid since 2012.

There is no official information about casualties after air strikes by the regime. Local council member Shadi Matar said aid had not yet been distributed ""because of the intensity of the raids."" The strikes came as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (mainly Arab and Kurdish forces) said they had encircled a stronghold of DAESH militants in Manbij northern Syria cutting off a major supply route. On June 1 Daraya received its first shipment of medical aid. ""The last time people were filling the streets waiting for the aid to come in"" activist Shadi Matar told AFP from inside Daraya. On May 12 a five-truck aid convoy waiting on Darayas outskirts was denied permission to enter in a dramatic 11th-hour rejection.

""Such attacks are unacceptable in any circumstance but in this case they also hampered the delivery and distribution of badly needed assistance"". French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also accused Damascus of ""extraordinary duplicity"" over the bombings. Ayrault said he was ""outraged beyond words"" declaring the end of the Russian-US brokered ""cessation of hostilities"" deal. According to deal the warring sides would stop fighting each other. It does not include DAESH and Al Qaeda-affiliated al Nusra Front.

1924058090,Russian and Syrian strikes kill 58 civilians,"26 Jun 2016 Russian and Syrian strikes death toll has risen while SDF fighters make gains in Manbij. Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89. A two-day freeze on fighting brokered by Moscow and Washington this month expired without renewal.

1924058091,US-Russia brokered Syria truce ends,"19 Sep 2016 At least 10 people were killed on Sunday when barrel bombs were dropped by regime forces on an opposition-held town in Daraa. Smoke rises after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Deraa Governorate Syria September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A fragile ceasefire between Bashar al Assads regime and Syrian opposition forces that was brokered by the US and Russia last week has ended with no word of a renewed truce on Monday. From the outset the week-long truce was marred by violations. Regime helicopters dropped four barrel bombs on an opposition-held town of Dael in the southern province of Daraa killing 10 people including a child the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. People move an injured man inside a field hospital after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Daraa Governorate Syria September 18 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Airstrikes were also reported in Aleppo Syrias largest city and former commercial hub. There was no confirmation as to whether or not the Syrian regime or its allied Russian airforce both of which have oversight of Syrian airspace were responsible. The incidents came just a day after US-led coalition forces killed dozens of regime fighters south of Deir al Zor after mistaking them for DAESH terrorists triggering criticism from Moscow. The War In Syria Interview with Alexey Khlebnikov from Russia Direct on US strikes on regime forces - YouTube Russia has backed the Assad regime since the war in Syria began in 2011 while the US has long called on Assad to step down. The superpowers have been targeting DAESH with parallel military campaigns in Syria forcing the terrorist group to retreat from swathes of land it took control of across the country in 2013 and 2014. But the Syrian war has placed Washington and Moscow at loggerheads with Russia seeking to prop up the regime while US-led coalition airstrikes on DAESH aim to pave the way for US-backed groups to take control. Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bomber dropping off bombs in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. (Reuters) Ceasefire failed and ended A number of violations on both sides have threatened the ceasefire. Zakaria Malahifji head of the political office of the Aleppo-based opposition group Fastaqim told Reuters he believed the truce had ""practically failed and has ended."" Malahifji also expressed doubt that UN aid trucks stuck on the Turkish border would reach besieged areas of eastern Aleppo. ""There is no hope. It has been a number of days of procrastination. Every day there is a pretext. There is no hope of aid being delivered currently"" he said. Up to 300000 people in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo are running low on vital supplies due to siege by the regime which is yet to give permission to the 20-vehicle convoy waiting in the Turkish city of Gaziantep permission to cross into Syria.

Both sides have laid the blame on each other for ceasefire violations. On Sunday Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov in an emailed statement accused ""terrorists and the opposition"" of using the ceasefire to ""boost their forces and prepare for renewed hostilities"". Russia has also called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting after claiming over 60 regime fighters were killed by the US-led airstrikes on Saturday. The War In Syria Interview with Richard Weitz from Hudson Institute on incendiary strikes in Syria - YouTube In turn US Secretary of State John Kerry called on Russia to ""stop the grandstanding stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going."" ""Russias client Russias supported friend is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here"" Kerry told CNN in reference to the regimes failure to grant access to the UN aid convoy.

1924058092,Air strikes in Syria kill at least 45 people,10 Sep 2016 Jet strikes blamed on the Syrian regime hit the opposition-held cities killing more than 40 people and wounding 90 hours after the US and Russia announced a deal intended to bring a ceasefire in the war-torn country. A Syrian man carries a child at the scene of a reported air strike on the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib on September 10 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 45 people have been killed after intense airstrikes on Saturday on and around the northern rebel-held city of Aleppo according to opposition activists. TRT World reported the death count could be over 50. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said 45 people were killed on Saturday just hours after the new US-Russian agreement was reached to try and end the violence in Syria. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 people were killed in Aleppo province and another 39 were killed by airstrikes in neighboring Idlib province. Syrian men search for victims at the scene of a reported air strike on the rebel-held northwestern city of Idlib on September 10 2016. (AFP) Contrasting casualty figures are common in the aftermath of large attacks in Syria. The United States and Russia announced a deal Saturday that would establish a nationwide cease-fire starting on Monday. Earlier it was reported that airstrikes on Idlib have killed at least 24 people. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that more than 90 people might have been wounded in the air strikes which hit a market place and several other areas of the city and it was not immediately clear who carried out the strikes. An Agence France Presse photographer at the scene saw men clambering over rubble in just slippers or sandals to help evacuate wounded dust-covered residents and children from a collapsing building.

(Reuters) Local civil defence personnel told Reuters that bodies were still being removed from the rubble of buildings destroyed in the strikes. Reuters also reported residents and rescue workers as saying that two dozen people were killed in the strikes and that Russian jets acting in support of the Bashar al Assads regime forces identified as such because they were flying in sorties at a high altitude may have been responsible. Since spring 2015 most of Idlib Province has been held by an alliance of rebel groups known as the Army of Conquest. More than 290000 people have been killed since the conflict in Syria first erupted in March 2011 and several attempts at securing a long-lasting truce have failed.

1924058093,String of bomb blasts kill at least 42 in Syria,"5 Sep 2016 At least 42 people were killed and dozens more wounded in simultaneous bomb blasts that hit Tartous Homs and Hasakeh cities of Syria. A general view shows the damage at a site of an explosion in Bab Tadmor in Homs Syria in this handout picture provided by SANA on September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A string of bomb blasts hit mostly regime-controlled areas of Syria on Monday killing at least 42 people and wounding dozens more local media said. The blasts hit regime-held Tartous and Homs as well as Hasakeh which is mostly controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate YPG. Regime media said at least 30 people had been killed and 45 injured in a double bomb attack just outside the city of Tartous in the coastal province of the same name which is a stronghold of Bashar al-Assads regime. A car bomb exploded on the Arzuna bridge followed by a suicide bomber who detonated his explosive belt when people gathered to help the wounded Syrian regime television said. No individual or group claimed responsibility for the attacks. Tartous which also hosts a Russian military base has largely been spared the worst violence of Syrias conflict since it began with pro-democracy protests in March 2011. Bab Tadmor Homs - SANA pic.twitter.comwAOZTxImcu Hassan Ridha (sayedridha) September 5 2016 Regime media also reported that eight people were killed in a bombing in Hasakeh in the northeast of the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the blast hit a checkpoint under the control of the YPG. Hasakeh city has been regularly targeted by DAESH including in July when a bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 16 people outside a bakery in the city. The terrorist group has been losing ground to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces which is mainly comprised of the YPG even though its affiliate organisation the PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and the EU. More recently DAESH has also lost territory to Turkish-backed Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters. Over the weekend advances by the Turkish Army and Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters expelled DAESH from the last stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border under their control. (TRT World and Agencies) Turkish Armed Forces launched Operation Euphrates Shield on August 24 to protect its borders and secure the Turkish town of Karkamis adjoining Syria from DAESH attacks. Simultaneous attacks In central Homs city regime media said at least three people were killed in a car bomb at the entrance to the Al-Zahraa neighbourhood whose residents mostly belong to the same Alawite sect as Assad. Al-Zahraa has also been regularly targeted in bomb attacks including a devastating double bomb blast in February that killed 57 people and was claimed by DAESH. Syrian regime soldiers stand at a site of an explosion in Bab Tadmor in Homs Syria in this handout picture provided by SANA on September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Regime television broadcast images from the aftermath of the blast in Homs showing rubble strewn on the streets and smoke rising from the charred remains of vehicles. Another bomb attack was also reported on the Al-Sabura road west of the capital Damascus with regime media saying one person had been killed and three injured in that bombing. The Observatory said that the attack targeted a checkpoint and gave a death toll of three. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the blasts appeared to be coordinated. ""Clearly these attacks were simultaneous and they all targeted security posts"" he told AFP. More than 290000 people have been killed in Syria since the war started and millions have been displaced by the fighting. Successive rounds of international negotiations aimed at finding a political solution have failed to bear fruit but US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are due to resume discussions on stemming the violence on Monday.

1924058094,Heavy air strikes hit opposition-held parts of Aleppo,"22 Sep 2016 In the heaviest attack in months fighter jets pounded the opposition-held districts of the Syrian city of Aleppo overnight days after a week-long ceasefire brokered by the US and Russia collapsed. Hamza al-Khatib the director of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters the death toll from the strikes was 45. The strikes come after Russia and the Syrian regime rejected a US plea to halt flights burying any hope for the revival of the ceasefire. Opposition officials and rescue workers said incendiary bombs were among the weapons used on the city. ""Its as if the planes are trying to compensate for all the days they didnt drop bombs during the ceasefire"" Ammar al-Selmo the head of the Civil Defense rescue service in opposition-held eastern Aleppo told Reuters. A man runs with a stretcher at a damaged site after air strikes on the opposition-held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo Syria September 21 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) ""It was like there was coordination between the planes and the artillery shelling because the shells were hitting the same locations that the planes hit"" he said. The assault by aircraft from the Syrian regime its Russian allies or both made it clear that Moscow and Damascus had rejected a plea by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt flights so that aid could be delivered and a ceasefire salvaged. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian regime or mention on regime-run media of Thursdays bombardment. ""It was the heaviest air strikes for months inside Aleppo city"" said Rami Abdulrahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the conflict from Britain. Homs evacuation Assad has appeared as uncompromising as ever in recent weeks reiterating his goal of taking back the whole country on the day the US-Russian brokered truce took effect. The regimes main focus has been to consolidate its grip over the main cities of western Syria and the coastal region that is the ancestral homeland of Assads Alawite sect. On Thursday around 120 opposition fighters and their families were evacuated from the last opposition-held district of Homs under an agreement with the regime by which they were given safe passage to nearby opposition-held areas. Families carry their luggage into a bus to evacuate the besieged district of Waer in the central Syrian city of Homs after a local agreement reached between opposition forces and Syrian regime military forces September 22 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) The opposition says such agreements are part of a regime strategy to forcibly displace populations from opposition-held areas after years of siege and bombardment. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates several thousand opposition fighters remain in the al-Waer district. UN resumes aid deliveries A ""clearly marked"" UN convoy was due to deliver aid on Thursday to besieged areas near the Syrian capital after a 48-hour suspension to review security guarantees following an attack on relief trucks near Aleppo a UN spokesman said.

US officials believe Russian aircraft were responsible for the strike but Moscow has denied involvement and the Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a US Predator drone was in the area when the convoy was attacked. ""We are sending today an inter-agency convoy that will cross conflict lines into a besieged area of rural Damascus"" Jens Laerke spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told Reuters. ""We will advise on the exact locations once the convoy has actually reached those locations."" Assad says Syria war will ""drag on"" Syrian regime leader Bashar al-Assad said in an interview with AP News broadcast on Thursday that Syrias war will ""drag on"" as long as it is funded and interfered in by other countries. The War In Syria Defiant Bashar al Assad speaks out - YouTube ""When you talk about it as part of a global conflict and a regional conflict when you have many external factors that you dont control its going to drag on"" Assad said. Assad told AP that Russia was not behind a deadly attack on an aid convoy on Monday which US officials have said they believe Moscow was responsible for. Assad cast doubt on the intentions of the United States in Syria saying it ""doesnt have the will"" to fight militants. ""I dont believe the United States will be ready to join Russia in fighting terrorists in Syria...the United States is not genuine regarding having a cessation of violence in Syria.""

1924058095,UNICEF says 22 schoolchildren and six teachers killed in Syria raid,"26 Oct 2016 Air strikes on Syrias opposition-held Idlib province hit a school and the surrounding area on Wednesday killing 22 children and six teachers the UN childrens agency UNICEF said Wednesday. ""This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime"" said UNICEF director Anthony Lake. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) earlier said ""warplanes either Russia or Syrian carried out six strikes"" in the village of Hass including on a school complex killing at least 35 civilians including 11 schoolchildren. The White Helmets civil defence group released pictures of four rescue workers clambering over a mound of rubble in search of survivors after what it said was a ""double-tap"" strike on the school. Initial reports of 6 killed & many injured after KafrTakharim in Idlib was targeted with an airstrike last night.httpst.co7yzW74JRrW pic.twitter.comsRZBdQcoeo The White Helmets (SyriaCivilDef) October 24 2016 The raids hit Hass around 1130 am (0830 GMT) an activist with the opposition Idlib Media Centre said. ""One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids"" the activist said speaking on condition of anonymity. Lake said the school compound was ""repeatedly attacked"" adding that it may be the deadliest attack on a school since the war began more than five years ago. ""When will the worlds revulsion at such barbarity be matched by insistence that this must stop?"" added the UNICEF director.

(TRT World and Agencies) Other activists from the province circulated a photograph on social media of a childs arm seared off above the elbow still clutching the strap of a dusty black rucksack.

(TRT World and Agencies) The latest attacks took to 89 the number of civilians killed in air strikes on Idlib province in the past seven days said the Observatory. Asked about the attack Russias UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin responded ""Its horrible horrible. I hope we were not involved."" ""Its the easiest thing for me to say no but Im a responsible person so I need to see what my Ministry of Defence is going to say."" Syrian regime forces and their Russian ally have been accused by rights groups of carrying out indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure. Intentional attack A leading opposition group condemned the raids. The Istanbul-based National Coalition said Russian and regime warplanes ""targeted children in their schools deliberately and intentionally hitting civilians with high-explosive material"". Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of opposition groups and militants including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with Al Qaeda earlier this year.

Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011 with protests calling for the ouster of regime leader Bashar al Assad. The civil war pits Bashar al Assad backed by Russia Iran and Shia Muslim militias from Lebanon Iraq and Afghanistan against an array of mostly Sunni Muslim opposition groups including some backed by Turkey Gulf monarchies and the United States. More than 300000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes.

1924058098,Russian and Syrian regime strikes kill over 80 in Aleppo,"13 Oct 2016 In fresh strikes Russian and Syrian regime jets pounded opposition-held parts of Aleppo early on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Severe bombardment on Syrias biggest city has killed at least 84 civilians including children the monitor and a civil defence official said. The fresh aerial assault was accompanied by the regimes advance on the northeastern outskirts of Aleppo where its forces captured several hilltops overlooking the opposition-held areas. Air strikes killed 13 people on Thursday when warplanes hit several rebel-held districts including al-Kalaseh Bustan al-Qasr and al-Sakhour civil defense official Ibrahim Abu al-Laith told Reuters from Aleppo. Seven children were among 71 civilians killed in opposition-held areas on Tuesday and Wednesday SOHR head Rami Abdel Rahman said. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged parts of eastern Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) ""The toll jumped because there were so many people who died of their wounds and others whose bodies were still stuck under the rubble"" he added. The Syrian regime forces launched the offensive to retake the whole of Aleppo on September 22. Eastern Aleppo has been held by the opposition fighters since 2012. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged parts of the city. The regime operation has been backed by Moscow which stepped up its air strikes against opposition-held areas earlier this week. A ceasefire in Syria brokered by the US and Russia collapsed last month. The Russian government and Syrian regime blamed their foes for breaking the ceasefire. Russia last week vetoed a UN Security Council resolution chalked out by France calling for an end to the bombings in Aleppo. Kerry and Lavrov to meet in Switzerland US officials on Wednesday said US Secretary of State John Kerry will meet his Russian counterpart in Switzerland on Saturday to discuss Syria. The meeting will include foreign ministers from Turkey Qatar Saudi Arabia and Iran. Earlier Kerry broke off talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the offensive which included air strikes on hospitals. The US and France termed the assaults ""war crimes"" and said Syria and Russia were responsible. The resumption of talks despite the offensive underlined the lack of options facing Western nations over the Syria conflict.

""There is renewed bombardment and it is heavy"" Zakaria Malhifji of the Aleppo based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. Russia and the Syrian regime had reduced air raids in the northern city over the last week. Regime forces said it was partly to allow civilians to leave opposition-held eastern neighbourhoods. The regime previously said that opposition holed up in Aleppo can leave with their families if they lay down their arms but the opposition has denounced that offer as a deception. Regime leader Bashar al Assad vowed to completely recapture Aleppo which has been divided between the regime and opposition control since the war began in 2011.

1924058102,Suicide bombing kills 29 at Syria-Turkey border,"6 Oct 2016 At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide bombing that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the casualties included fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) the Turkish-backed force which has played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the FSA the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement DAESH has claimed responsibilty for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the Failaq al-Sham. The group has been fighting alongside other Turkish-backed factions in Ankaras offensive dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"" against DAESH. (TRT World and Agencies) The fighters use the Atmeh crossing to move between the Syrian province of Idlib through Turkey to the areas where anti-DAESH operations are taking place the Observatory said. Residents said they also use it to evacuate wounded fighters. Among the dead from the Atmeh blast were the head of the top civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed and a judge who worked with him a witness and a rebel official said. Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a bastion of the opposition groups fighting Bashar al-Assads regime. The multi-sided civil war has raged on for more than five years. Opposition fighters have been targeted at the crossing before. DAESH claimed responsibility for a mid-August suicide attack there that killed at least 32. The fighters killed on Thursday were also among those participating in Euphrates Shield. Ankara began the unprecedented cross-border operation on August 24 saying it was targeting both DAESH and the YPG which Turkey considers a terrorist group. The operation has so far captured the DAESH stronghold of Jarablus and is pushing towards the towns of Dabiq and Al-Bab.

1924058105,Car bomb attack kills at least 26 in Syria war monitor says,"17 Nov 2017 The death toll could rise because of the number of serious injuries says the war monitor. (AP Archive) A car bombing blamed on Daesh killed at least 26 displaced people in eastern Syria on Friday the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The war monitor said that 12 children were among the victims of the attack on a gathering at a checkpoint run by US-backed militants of the YPG-dominated-SDF in Deir Ezzor province where Daesh is losing ground to two separate offensives aimed at ousting it from Syria. ""Dozens of people were wounded and the death toll could rise because of the number of serious injuries"" said SHOR director Rami Abdel Rahman. The displaced people had been on their way to neighbouring Hasakeh province where camps have been set up to house them in YPG-controlled territory Abdel Rahman said. Daesh battling for survival Daesh controls roughly one quarter of oil-rich Deir Ezzor province but is battling for survival on two fronts. One offensive against it is by Syrian regime forces backed by Russian air power while the second is by YPG. Daesh group is now cornered in part of Deir Ezzor province around the border town of Abu Kamal on the frontier with Iraq and many civilians have been trying to flee the affected areas. The group seized large areas of both Syria and Iraq in a lightning 2014 campaign but has this year seen its self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" crumble as it came under multiple offensives.

1924058106,Air strikes kill dozens inside Syria de-escalation zone,"14 Nov 2017 Air strikes that ripped through a market in a rebel-held Syrian town have killed at least 61 people mostly civilians a war monitor said on Tuesday. Three strikes hit the northwestern town of Atareb on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said despite a ""de-escalation zone"" in place there. ""A number of people died of their wounds bringing the toll to 61 people including five children and three policemen"" SOHR said. The Britain-based monitor said it was not clear whether the bombing raids had been carried out by Syrian government warplanes or those of its ally Russia. TRT Worlds Ahmed al Burai reports from Idlib in Syria. Air strikes on Atareb kill dozens of civilians - YouTube Air strikes were in ""de-escalation zone"" Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed under a deal earlier this year between the regimes allies Russia and Iran and opposition backer Turkey. The agreement is regularly violated. The zone mostly covers neighbouring Idlib province which is largely held by opposition forces and the formerly al Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al Sham previously known as the Al Nusra Front. Despite the regimes recapture of Aleppo city late last year rebel groups maintain a presence in the west of the province. Atareb has been hit by Russian and Syrian regime air strikes since 2015 when Russia intervened in the war in Syria turning the tide in the regimes favour. The town has become home to tens of thousands of people displaced by fighting in nearby areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria and 11 million displaced since the conflict began in March 2011 with protests against Bashar al Assads regime.

1924058107,At least seven children die in regime shelling at rebel-held area in Syria,31 Oct 2017 At least seven Syrian children were killed in regime shelling of a rebel-held area outside Damascus on Tuesday most as they left school activists said. The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

1924058109,Russia air strikes kill at least 14 civilians in Syria monitor,"6 Oct 2017 Members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Syrian fighters backed by US special forces take a position inside a building on the eastern frontline of Raqa on October 5 2017. (AFP) (AFP) Russian air strikes killed at least 14 civilians as they were crossing the Euphrates river near the militant-held town of Al Mayadeen in eastern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Friday. ""They were crossing the river on makeshift rafts in a village south of Mayadeen"" SOHR director Rami Abdel Rahman said adding that three children were among those killed overnight. Russia has in recent days intensified its air raids in support of Syrian regime forces battling militants across the country. Abdel Rahman said the civilians were fleeing the village of Mahkan south of Al Mayadeen which lies about 420 km east of Damascus and is one of the Daeshs main remaining bastions. Al Mayadeen has been under Daesh control since 2014 when the group swept across swathes of Iraq and Syria and proclaimed a ""caliphate"" but regime forces this week advanced to within five km of the town. Poised for Al Mayadeen A military media unit run by the Lebanese Hezbollah group says regime forces and its allies gained control of positions and heights parallel to the main road linking Deir Ezzor and Al Mayadeen located on the Euphrates in eastern Syria. SOHR said the forces were only six km away from the city. Daesh becomes virtual caliphate Experts and officials say Daeshs ""virtual caliphate"" could be hard to conquer. The militant propaganda machine will continue to exist in hidden corners of the dark web inciting sympathisers to action they say. ""Defeating ISIL (Daesh) on the physical battlefield is not enough"" General Joseph Votel the top commander for US military forces in the Middle East warned earlier this year. ""Following even a decisive defeat in Iraq and Syria ISIL (Daesh) will likely retreat to a virtual safe haven a virtual caliphate from which it will continue to coordinate and inspire external attacks as well as build a support base until the group has the capability to reclaim physical territory."" He described this online network as ""a distorted version of the historic Islamic caliphate it is a stratified community of Muslims who are led by a caliph (currently Abu Bakr al Baghdadi) aspire to participate in a state governed by sharia and are located in the global territory of cyberspace."" Under pressure from public authorities internet providers and major online players are beginning to put in place measures and procedures to disrupt Daeshs exploitation of the web.

1924058110,At least 17 dead as suicide bombings hit Damascus,"3 Oct 2017 At least 17 people were killed and many more injured on Monday by suicide bombings that targeted a police station in the Midan neighbourhood of Damascus the capital of Syria. Several suicide bombers believed to have been three detonated themselves in front of and inside the police station according to authorities. Local police officers learned that one of the bombers used a hand grenade to attack the police station from a viaduct before he detonated his explosive device at about 1330 on the viaduct which runs parallel to the police station. ""Previously the attacker whose identity was unknown attacked us. The terrorists outside the police station launched the attack from the viaduct. Police officers and the army unit together resisted and foiled the attack"" said Tarek a police officer. Afterward another bomber detonated his explosive device at the gate of the police station while a third bomber entered the police station and detonated his explosive device after being surrounded by police officers and an army unit. The Syrian regimes Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. Daesh said three of its fighters carried out an attack on a Damascus police station on Monday. In a statement distributed on a Daesh channel via the Telegram messaging service on Tuesday the group said two of the fighters fired shots in the station before blowing themselves up. The third blew himself up later as ""reinforcements"" arrived. Local state television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Policemen carried one body away from the scene wrapped inside a white tarpaulin. The same police station in Midan was targeted last December when a seven-year-old female suicide bomber blew herself up inside the station. Local reactions According to a witness because the explosion occurred during working hours and the proximity of the police station to the old city of Damascus many people were killed and nearby cars houses and buildings were all destroyed. ""This is a crime. Its a terrorist act. Nobody will accept such an act. It is tragic to see the corpses on the ground. We just began having better conditions and good supplies but what about those people who lost their cars and houses?"" said a local resident. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Monday afternoon. I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook she said. Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move out of the way and clear the road so ambulances can get through to retrieve the injured she added. Damascus attacks Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions including the Jobar neighbourhood. They also hold territory in the eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since its conflict began with protests that were met with a harsh regime crackdown.

1924058111,Unidentified air strike kills at least eight Hezbollah fighters in Syria,"2 Oct 2017 Air strike struck a Hezbollah position in eastern Homs province where the Iran-backed Lebanese group is fighting Daesh alongside the Syrian regime and Russian forces. The identity of the drone was not confirmed but the sources did not rule out the possibility that it was Russian ""friendly fire"". (AFP) A drone strike on Monday killed at least eight members of the Hezbollah militia in Syria where the Lebanese group is fighting alongside the Syrian regime a Britain-based monitor said. An unidentified ""drone hit a Hezbollah position near the town of Sukhna (in central Homs province) killing eight fighters and injuring more than 20"" said Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Asked about a report that a US drone carried out the strike the spokesman for the US-led coalition said the location was outside its area of operations. Hezbollah is a key force multiplier for Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad and has fought alongside his forces across the country against rebel forces. Assads forces and allied fighters are currently waging a campaign in Syrias vast Badiya desert region against Daesh. The campaign backed by Assad ally Russia has captured large swathes of territory from the terror group but they have launched deadly counterattacks on regime positions.

1924058115,At least 44 killed dozens injured as twin bombing targets Syrias Qamishli near Turkish border - Daily Sabah,"Published July 27 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.ly912r3U DHA Photo A twin bombing struck a crowd in a predominantly Kurdish town in northern Syria on Wednesday killing 44 people and wounding dozens more Syrias state-run news agency and Kurdish media reported. The Daesh group claimed responsibility for the attack. Media reports said a truck loaded with large quantities of explosives blew up on the western edge of the town of Qamishli followed by an explosives-packed motorcycle a few minutes later in the same area. The blasts caused massive damage in the area and rescue teams were working to recover victims from under the rubble the SANA news agency said. This photo captured from the town of Nusaybin near the Turkish side of the border shows plume of smoke occurred after the explosion. (IHA Photo) Qamishli near the Turkish border is mainly controlled by PYD but Syrian regime forces are present and control the towns airport. Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars. Qamishli resident Suleiman Youssef a writer told The Associated Press by telephone that he heard the first explosion from few miles away. He said the blasts leveled several buildings to the ground and many people were trapped under the rubble. ""Most of the buildings at the scene of the explosion have been heavily damaged because of the strength of the blast"" he said. The Daesh group in a statement published by its affiliated Aamaq news agency said it carried out the attack in Qamishli describing it as a truck bombing that struck a complex of Kurdish offices. The terrorist group has carried out several bombings in Kurdish areas in Syria in the past. The PYD-dominated and U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces have been the main force fighting Daesh in northern Syria capturing significant territory from the terrorists over the past two years.

DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. ""Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there"" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city ""Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering.""",dailysabah,8/7/2016,aleppo,1,publish august 15 2016 send httpsabahdailyraa1yc syrian man cover dust carri piec metal street clutter rubbl follow airstrik rebelheld neighborhood sakhur aleppo daesh said kill least 50 opposit fighter suicid bomb bu near atmeh border cross turkey opposit face daesh threat fight intens syrian regim idlib aleppo daesh said monday respons suicid bomb bu sunday kill fighter westernback syrian opposit group near atmeh border cross turkey statement one telegram channel hardlin milit group said kill 50 fighter travel bu failaq alsham alzinki group said fighter travel fight daesh northern aleppo provinc britainbas syrian observatori human right said suicid bomber struck bu transport fighter atmeh border post one sever cross syrian opposit use bring fighter suppli monitor group reli activist insid syria said attack kill 50 fighter activist spoke condit anonym fear retribut said 200 fighter variou faction base near atmeh bring weapon cross observatori earlier report 26 airstrik sunday across idlib one last remain opposit bastion observatori head rami abdurrahman said russian govern airstrik provinc intensifi sinc opposit fighter launch campaign idlib break govern sieg aleppo opposit district juli 31 strike kill 122 civilian said anoth 327 civilian includ 126 children kill fight aleppo provinc accord observatori toll includ 126 peopl kill opposit shell governmentheld part aleppo citi local coordin committe activist network said russian jet struck town jisr alshaghour binnish observatori report strike provinci capit idlib unclear activist identifi plane aleppo still home 2 million peopl live governmentcontrol western district syrian govern forc monday repel renew opposit assault southwest citi aleppo forc opposit forc retreat posit seiz daili earlier syrian govern activist said develop follow intens battl two side ten thousand syrian displac aleppo found refug idlib home prewar popul 15 million sunday even opposit fighter open new front send truck bomb aleppo western zahraa neighborhood accord twitter account islam front one faction fight citi observatori report fight citi western southern district moscow wage air campaign support govern forc nearli year russia militari said six longrang tu22m3 bomber took russian territori carri strike sunday daesh near eastern syrian citi deir elzour made mention strike idlib russian foreign minist sergei lavrov said monday syrian opposit group use temporari ceasefir around aleppo regroup rearm lavrov speak news confer russian citi yekaterinburg german counterpart frankwalt steinmeier said realiz brief daili ceasefir place allow aid enter civilian leav suffici said difficult make ceasefir longer moment risk milit use regroup rearm someth said done past german govern spokesman steffen seibert said hardship face peopl aleppo could allevi announc threehour ceasefir suppos sound like concess actual cynic everybodi know amount time nowher near suffici actual build suppli desper peopl told govern news confer said kill aleppo stop citi need receiv food medic item without hindranc seibert said syria bashar assad russia alli assad opposit syria fiveyearold civil war larg respons situat citi primarili decis whether death whether peopl get help hope month suffer

A regime helicopter struck twice a mourning location in the opposition-held Bab al-Nairab district in Aleppo Ibrahim Abu Leith told Anadolu Agency. ""Twenty people were killed and 30 others injured in the attack"" he said. According to Abu Leith women and children were among the fatalities. He said the second attack took place when the helicopter dropped another barrel bomb on people who rushed to the scene to help the victims of the first attack. The injured were rushed to field hospitals amid fears that death toll may rise as a number of civilians remain trapped under the debris of their destroyed homes.

1924058138,Syria uses chemical weapons Turkey offers remedy - lnur evik - Daily Sabah,"Published April 5 2017 The jet fighters from the Syrian regime have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Idlib with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of the Bashar Assad administration. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are ""monitoring"" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of ""suffocation"" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had ""given up"" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria. But the fact that Assad is using his jet fighters and helicopters to attack even the civilians who sympathize with the Syrian opposition shows the urgent need for declaring the safe zones created by Turkey as no-fly zones. This is something that has to be looked into by the international community. The Russians can secure this zone with their air power and their ground to air S-400 missile systems thus at least offering some hope for the Syrian people trying to escape Assads atrocities.",dailysabah,4/13/2017,idlib,1,publish april 5 2017 jet fighter syrian regim attack settlement syrian provinc idlib chemic weapon kill least 70 peopl includ dozen women children display barbar bashar assad administr happen socal ceasefir effect region russian monitor idlib target regim opposit group sympath move aleppo agreement broker turkey russia ceasefir suppos secur protect peopl idlib proven wrong regim jet fighter attack citi chemic bomb local sourc report syrian helicopt also attack sever settlement area barrel bomb contain chemic weapon doctor town khan skeikhoun idlib provinc held opposit said victim start choke vomit faint foam come mouth ukbas syrian observatori human right said women children among dozen kill report suffoc barrel bomb assad regim back use chemic weapon intern commun view monstrou atroc assad regim done intern uproar given chemic weapon intern observ told assad chemic weapon assad back use weapon seem intern commun intent unintent simpli turn blind eye assad regim simpli store weapon use futur date russian mentor terrorist assad face terrorist attack backyard st petersburg see collabor terrorist bring miseri destruct time assad stop chemic weapon assad use taken away good pay atroc even russian cannot stand behind assad commit gross violat american cant simpli say interest fight daesh turn blind eye danger turn event idlib tomorrow someon syria may decid use weapon us forc thereturkey tri creat secur zone assad would never dare attack northern syria fact assad use jet fighter helicopt attack even civilian sympath syrian opposit show urgent need declar safe zone creat turkey nofli zone someth look intern commun russian secur zone air power ground air s400 missil system thu least offer hope syrian peopl tri escap assad atroc
1924058139,At least 100 civilians dead in toxic gas attack in Syrias Idlib,"Published April 4 2017 The Assad regime has used chemical weapons once again killing at least 100 civilians including children in an airstrike that released on the opposition-held Idlib. Thirty ambulances were dispatched from Turkey to rescue those in dire need of help. The Assad regime continues to commit crimes against humanity as more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 others mostly children have been affected by the chlorine gas attack carried out by regime warplanes in the Khan Shaykun town in Idlib. The latest chemical attack was seen as the worst in the countys six-year war. With many civilians suffering respiratory problems in dire need of help Turkey dispatched 30 fully equipped ambulances for rescue operations. The reports claim that it was the third chemical attack in over a week in Syria as the Assad regime consistently targets residential areas. The first two attacks were reported in Hama province an area close to yesterdays chemical attack. After the gas attack the Syrian regime reportedly bombarded a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims. Turkey condemned the chemical attack on Syrias opposition-held town of Idlib describing it as ""a crime against humanity."" The chemical attacks on Idlib were ""inhuman"" and ""unacceptable"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said while stressing the importance of maintaining the fragile Syrian cease-fire. In a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the president reiterated the need for further efforts to strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Minister Mevlt avuolu also stated that the suspected use of chemical weapons could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. The parallel series of talks in Astana Kazakhstan aim to bolster the truce to support the U.N. negotiations. Damascus has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with the moderate Syrian opposition making large incursions into the east of the Syrian capital while the Assad regime has responded with airstrikes on opposition positions. The last round of Astana talks began on Feb. 23 and ended on March 4 without any clear result. The next meetings in Astana are to be held on May 3-4. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was ""seriously concerned"" by reports of a suspected gas attack. ""The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is seriously concerned about the alleged chemical weapons attack reported by the media this morning in the Khan Sheikhun area of southern Idlib"" the group said adding it was ""gathering and analyzing information from all available sources."" Chlorine gas is one of several elements and compounds used in devastating chemical attacks outlawed by international treaties. A high level of exposure to the gas can cause suffocation as the chemical injures the pulmonary airways resulting in severe fluid buildup in the lungs with children and seniors particularly vulnerable. In the wake of the 2013 attack Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. His government declared a 1300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons amid international outrage at a nerve gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus. Those weapons have been destroyed but member states of the OPCW have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything in 2013. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. Frances foreign minister called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a ""disgusting"" gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. ""In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N.

1924058142,Russian strike kills 18 civilians in Syrias Idlib monitor,Published April 8 2017 An air strike killed 18 civilians including five children in Syrias northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. The monitoring group updated its earlier death toll of 15 for the strike on Urum al-Joz saying three more people had died of serious injuries. It said the strike was believed to have been carried out by Russian planes which operate in support of the Assad regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by an opposition alliance and is regularly targeted by both the Assad regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assad regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning.,dailysabah,4/9/2017,idlib,1,publish april 8 2017 air strike kill 18 civilian includ five children syria northwestern provinc idlib saturday syrian observatori human right monitor said monitor group updat earlier death toll 15 strike urum aljoz say three peopl die seriou injuri said strike believ carri russian plane oper support assad regim observatori reli network sourc insid syria inform say determin whose plane carri raid accord type locat flight pattern munit use idlib provinc control opposit allianc regularli target assad regim russian alli earlier week chemic attack hit town khan sheikhun idlib kill least 87 civilian includ 31 children khan sheikhun strike prompt washington take first direct militari action assad regim missil strike central air base friday morn

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Daesh members slit the throats of the men aged between 18 and 25 near the town of Mayadeen in Deir el-Zour province on Wednesday.

1924058145,US coalition airstrikes kill 20 civilians in east Syria,"Published April 19 2017 A war monitor said airstrikes thought to be by planes from a U.S.-led military coalition killed 20 civilians including children in two parts of the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor the Britain-based war monitoring group said yesterday. Jets ""believed to belong to the international coalition"" struck the town of al-Bukamal in the south of the province near the Iraqi border killing three militants and 13 civilians including children the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The monitoring group said airstrikes also killed seven civilians in the town of al-Husainiyah further north along the Euphrates river. There was no immediate comment from the coalition which has said it tries to avoid civilian deaths in its bombing campaigns against Daesh militants in Syria and neighboring Iraq. Earlier this month the coalition said its raids there and in Iraq and unintentionally killed at least 220 civilians. But other monitors say the number is much higher. Reports of civilian deaths from U.S. airstrikes across Syria and Iraq soared to an all-time high the reports said. According to Airwars a British monitoring group there were 1472 casualties linked to U.S. airstrikes in March. Daesh militants control most of Deir al-Zor province which links territory they hold in Syria and Iraq and parts of the provincial capital which has the same name. The Syrian regime still controls some parts of Deir al-Zor city including a nearby military air base where Daesh has besieged about 200000 people lacking food and medicine for around two years.

1924058146,Airstrikes in northern and eastern Syria kill 20 civilians activists,"Published April 18 2017 An overnight airstrike likely carried out by the U.S.-led coalition struck an eastern Syrian town held by the Daesh killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens opposition activists said. Another airstrike this one during the day hit a opposition-held village in the northwest on Tuesday killing a woman and nine children. The activists said the late Monday strike on the town of Boukamal on the Iraqi border was similar to airstrikes carried out by the U.S.-led coalition that has been targeting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition have killed dozens of civilians over the past several weeks as the battle against the extremists intensifies. The new purported took place as the U.S.-led coalition came under fire from Human Rights Watch over another deadly incident in northern Syria last month in which dozens of people were killed. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency said the strike of Boukamal killed six people and wounded 15 all of them women and children. It did not say whether any Daesh fighters were also killed. The U.S. militarys regional command CENTCOM said in response to a query by The Associated Press that it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Activists gave different casualty tolls. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Boukamal strike killed 15 civilians including women and children as well as three Iraqi Daesh fighters. Opposition activist Omar Abu Laila who currently lives in Europe but is from the province where the strike took place and maintains contacts there said 10 people were killed including an Iraqi family of four. He said Daesh cordoned off the area and cut all telecommunications after the strike which heavily damaged at least four buildings. ""The number of casualties is huge"" Abu Laila said adding that mosque loudspeakers were used to urge people to head to hospitals to donate blood. Daesh used to control wide parts of Syria and Iraq where the group declared a caliphate in 2014. Over the past year the extremists have suffered a string of defeats at the hands of an array of Syrian and Iraqi forces. On Tuesday in northern Syria an airstrike on the village of Maaret Harmeh killed 10 people and wounded several others activists said. The Observatory said those killed were all relatives. The Civil Defense another activist group said 10 people were also wounded in that attack. Maaret Harmeh is close to the town of Khan Sheikhoun where a chemical weapons attack killed nearly 90 people on April 4. The United States has accused the Assad regime of being behind the attack and fired missiles at a Syrian army base. Syria denies the charges. Meanwhile Human Rights Watch said in a report Tuesday that U.S. forces appear to have failed to take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties in a March 16 airstrike that killed dozens of people in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo. U.S. officials said at the time that the airstrike hit an al-Qaida gathering killing dozens of militants. Syrian opposition activists said around 40 people mostly civilians were killed in the crowded Omar Ibn al-Khattab Mosque in the Jeeneh district. U.S. officials at the time also said they found no basis for reports that civilians were killed. However Human Rights Watchs 16-page report said it found no evidence to support the allegation that members of al-Qaida or any other armed group were meeting in the mosque. It said a religious lecture was being held at the time of the attack and that prayers were about to begin. ""The U.S. seems to have gotten several things fundamentally wrong in this attack and dozens of civilians paid the price"" said Ole Solvang HRW deputy emergencies director. ""The U.S. authorities need to figure out what went wrong start doing their homework before they launch attacks and make sure it doesnt happen again."" Lama Fakih the New York-based watchdogs deputy for Mideast and North Africa told the AP that the report concluded the mosque strike killed at least 38 people. She added that the U.S.-led coalition appears to ""have failed to understand"" that the building being hit was a mosque.",dailysabah,4/5/2017,deir ezzor,0,publish april 18 2017 overnight airstrik like carri usl coalit struck eastern syrian town held daesh kill least 10 peopl wound dozen opposit activist said anoth airstrik one day hit oppositionheld villag northwest tuesday kill woman nine children activist said late monday strike town boukam iraqi border similar airstrik carri usl coalit target daesh syria iraq airstrik usl coalit kill dozen civilian past sever week battl extremist intensifi new purport took place usl coalit came fire human right watch anoth deadli incid northern syria last month dozen peopl kill daeshlink aamaq news agenc said strike boukam kill six peopl wound 15 women children say whether daesh fighter also kill us militari region command centcom said respons queri associ press awar report look activist gave differ casualti toll britainbas syrian observatori human right said boukam strike kill 15 civilian includ women children well three iraqi daesh fighter opposit activist omar abu laila current live europ provinc strike took place maintain contact said 10 peopl kill includ iraqi famili four said daesh cordon area cut telecommun strike heavili damag least four build number casualti huge abu laila said ad mosqu loudspeak use urg peopl head hospit donat blood daesh use control wide part syria iraq group declar caliph 2014 past year extremist suffer string defeat hand array syrian iraqi forc tuesday northern syria airstrik villag maaret harmeh kill 10 peopl wound sever other activist said observatori said kill rel civil defens anoth activist group said 10 peopl also wound attack maaret harmeh close town khan sheikhoun chemic weapon attack kill nearli 90 peopl april 4 unit state accus assad regim behind attack fire missil syrian armi base syria deni charg meanwhil human right watch said report tuesday us forc appear fail take necessari precaut avoid civilian casualti march 16 airstrik kill dozen peopl northern syrian provinc aleppo us offici said time airstrik hit alqaida gather kill dozen milit syrian opposit activist said around 40 peopl mostli civilian kill crowd omar ibn alkhattab mosqu jeeneh district us offici time also said found basi report civilian kill howev human right watch 16page report said found evid support alleg member alqaida arm group meet mosqu said religi lectur held time attack prayer begin us seem gotten sever thing fundament wrong attack dozen civilian paid price said ole solvang hrw deputi emerg director us author need figur went wrong start homework launch attack make sure doesnt happen lama fakih new yorkbas watchdog deputi mideast north africa told ap report conclud mosqu strike kill least 38 peopl ad usl coalit appear fail understand build hit mosqu
1924058147,At least 126 dead in blast targeting evacuation convoy stranded near Aleppo,"Published April 15 2017 At least 126 people including 68 children were killed Saturday in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged regime-held towns a monitoring group said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. The dead included 109 evacuees 13 of whom were women from the villages of Foua and Kefraya in the north-western province of Idlib the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The other fatalities were escorts and fighters who were on the site of the bombing outside the northern city of Aleppo according to the Britain-based watchdog. The toll is expected to rise because there are still critically injured and missing people after the blast the Observatory said. The blast hit the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts where dozens of buses carrying mostly Shiiite residents of two villages al-Foua and Kefraya that are being evacuated in a deal between warring sides were waiting to enter the city. The state TV channel said the explosion was caused by a car bomb. State TV showed horrific images of bodies strewn on the ground and near buses. A senior opposition official said 20 fighters who guarded the buses were killed as well as dozens of passengers. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A military media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said a suicide attacker had detonated a car bomb near the convoy. Pictures posted on state media showed what appeared to be the aftermath of the explosion with bodies lying on the ground and fires belching out thick black plumes of smoke. Buses were blackened by the blast with their windows blown out. Thousands of Syrians were stuck in and around Aleppo on Saturday as a deal to evacuate people from two Shiite villages in return for Sunni opposition fighters and their families leaving two besieged towns near Damascus halted a war monitor and activists said. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the delay was because opposition groups from Zabadani one of the towns included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. The agreement is one of several concluded in recent months that has seen Bashar al-Assads regime take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. In the latest deal hundreds of rebels and their families evacuated the town of Madaya near Damascus and were taken to the regime-held city of Aleppo. From there they will travel to Idlib province an opposition stronghold. In return pro-regime fighters and residents from the Shiite villages of al-Foua and Kefraya both surrounded by Idlib opposition fighters have left the area and reached Aleppos outskirts. On Saturday those from Madaya sat outside rows of coaches in a bus garage in government-held Aleppo waiting to move onto Idlib pictures sent by a pro-opposition activist showed. Meanwhile residents from the Shiite villages were still waiting in insurgent territory on Aleppos outskirts to cross into the city the Observatory and a witness said. The pro-opposition activist said opposition fighters were saying that a smaller number of pro-regime fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage in Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday night and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the western city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad holds the military advantage over the opposition in the west of the country thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents continue to fight back and have made gains in some areas.",dailysabah,4/5/2017,aleppo,0,publish april 15 2017 least 126 peopl includ 68 children kill saturday suicid car bomb attack buse carri syrian evacu two besieg regimeheld town monitor group said sunday syrian observatori human right said 98 evacue northern town fuaa kafraya kill explosivesladen vehicl hit buse transit point west aleppo saturday dead includ 109 evacue 13 women villag foua kefraya northwestern provinc idlib syrian observatori human right said fatal escort fighter site bomb outsid northern citi aleppo accord britainbas watchdog toll expect rise still critic injur miss peopl blast observatori said blast hit rashidin area aleppo outskirt dozen buse carri mostli shiiit resid two villag alfoua kefraya evacu deal war side wait enter citi state tv channel said explos caus car bomb state tv show horrif imag bodi strewn ground near buse senior opposit offici said 20 fighter guard buse kill well dozen passeng spoke condit anonym author speak media militari media unit run damascu alli hezbollah said suicid attack deton car bomb near convoy pictur post state media show appear aftermath explos bodi lie ground fire belch thick black plume smoke buse blacken blast window blown thousand syrian stuck around aleppo saturday deal evacu peopl two shiit villag return sunni opposit fighter famili leav two besieg town near damascu halt war monitor activist said britishbas syrian observatori human right sohr said delay opposit group zabadani one town includ deal yet grant safe passag agreement one sever conclud recent month seen bashar alassad regim take back control area long besieg forc alli latest deal hundr rebel famili evacu town madaya near damascu taken regimeheld citi aleppo travel idlib provinc opposit stronghold return proregim fighter resid shiit villag alfoua kefraya surround idlib opposit fighter left area reach aleppo outskirt saturday madaya sat outsid row coach bu garag governmentheld aleppo wait move onto idlib pictur sent proopposit activist show meanwhil resid shiit villag still wait insurg territori aleppo outskirt cross citi observatori wit said proopposit activist said opposit fighter say smaller number proregim fighter left shiit villag agre madaya resid speak bu garag aleppo said peopl wait sinc late friday night allow leav there drink water food bu garag small there much space move around ahm 24 said sad angri happen said mani peopl felt forc leav said choic end besieg insid small area madaya syria opposit say evacu deal includ area aleppo district western citi hom amount forc displac assad oppon syria main urban center agreement also caus demograph chang say displac mostli sunni muslim syria popul mostli sunni assad alawit religi minor often consid offshoot shiit islam back militarili russia shiit fighter iran lebanes hezbollah group syria sixyearold conflict assad hold militari advantag opposit west countri thank russia intervent 2015 although insurg continu fight back made gain area
1924058148,US-led coalition airstrike kills 18 partner forces Pentagon says,"Published April 13 2017 An air strike on Tuesday by a U.S.-led coalition fighting Daesh mistakenly killed 18 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces south of the city of Tabqa Syria the Pentagon said on Thursday. ""The strike was requested by the partnered forces who had identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position"" it said in a statement referring to the Daesh terror group by an acronym. ""The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position."" Meanwhilee the U.S.-led coalition previously denied an Assad army report it had carried out an air strike that had hit poison gas supplies belonging to Daesh and caused the deaths of hundreds of people. ""The Coalition conducted no strikes in that area at that time. The Syrian claim is incorrect and likely intentional misinformation"" U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian a colaition spokesman told Reuters by email. The army of the Assad regime said Thursday that an air strike late on Wednesday by the U.S.-led coalition hit poison gas supplies belonging to the Daesh terror group releasing a toxic substance that killed ""hundreds including many civilians."" The incident in the eastern Deir al-Zor province proved that Daesh and al Qaeda-linked terrorists ""possess chemical weapons"" a statement by the army flashed on Thursday by Syrian state TV said. The United States launched cruise missiles at a Syrian air base last week in response to a deadly poison gas attack in the west of the country that Washington blamed on Bashar al-Assads regime. Syria and its ally Russia deny Damascus carried out any such chemical attack. Moscow has said the poison gas in that incident last week in Idlib province belonged to rebels. The U.S. strike on the Syrian air base was the first time Washington has deliberately and directly targeted the Syrian government.

1924058152,At least 8 White Helmets rescuers killed in airstrike in Syrias Hama,"Published April 29 2017 Airstrikes struck a center of Syrias rescuers known as the White Helmets in an opposition-held area in the countrys center killing eight volunteers opposition activists said Saturday. The airstrike was one of the deadliest against the rescuers who operate in opposition-held areas and who have garnered world attention for operating in extreme conditions pulling survivors out of recently struck areas. The volunteers have often been targeted by Assad regime airstrikes in what are known as double tap attacks as they work to rescue others. The local White Helmets in the central Hama province said an air raid on one of their centers in Kfar Zeita killed eight members of the team. The group said five bodies were lifted from the rubble and the rescuers continued to look for the others. The Britain-based opposition monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the number of those killed is likely to rise as the search regime and Russia aircraft have targeted opposition-held areas. The central Hama province have been scene to intense violence in recent weeks as the regime attempts to push back an opposition offensive. Separately Saturday regime army said its troops and allied fighters repelled an attack by Daesh terrorist group on a strategic area held by the regime in southern Aleppo province. The attack took place in Khanaser southeast Aleppo a strategic region that links Aleppo with central and western Syria. The area has changed hands many times during the conflict. But last year regime forces and allied fighters wrested control of Khanaser from Daesh. The military media arm said Daesh attacked Um Mayyal village near a mountain range in Khanaser and other areas. The Observatory said Daesh fighters launched the attack on military posts in the area triggering intense clashes and leaving many casualties. Daesh-affiliated Aamaq news agency claimed Daesh fighters killed 30 regime soldiers in the attack. Near the capital hundreds of Syrians from the oppositon-held suburbs of eastern Ghouta near Damascus protested against infighting between the insurgent groups that began Friday and left dozens killed in the area. The infighting came amid an intensified regime offensive in the area near Damascus which the opposition fighters have controlled for years but has been increasingly squeezed by regime advances. ""God rid us of all leaders"" the protesters chanted criticizing the head of the insurgent groups for diverting their weapons from the front line with the regime. The infighting is pitting the powerful Army of Islam group against al-Rahman Corps and al-Qaida-linked group the Levant Liberation Committee or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Each side blames the other for triggering the fighting in the power struggle over control of eastern Ghouta. Some activists have called on Army of Islam to rid eastern Ghouta of the powerful al-Qaida-linked group. The Observatory said shots were fired at the protesters in one area leaving five injured. In 24 hours of fighting the Observatory said at least 38 opposition fighters from the warring sides were killed. Damascus-based Shaam News Network put the number at 60 in addition to six civilians killed because of the clashes. For the past three years the regime has been unable to regain control of the eastern suburbs of Damascus. But in recent weeks an intensified offensive points to a new determination to retake the area. On Saturday activists reported a heavy air campaign against the areas Qaboun neighborhood.",dailysabah,4/10/2017,hama,0,publish april 29 2017 airstrik struck center syria rescuer known white helmet oppositionheld area countri center kill eight volunt opposit activist said saturday airstrik one deadliest rescuer oper oppositionheld area garner world attent oper extrem condit pull survivor recent struck area volunt often target assad regim airstrik known doubl tap attack work rescu other local white helmet central hama provinc said air raid one center kfar zeita kill eight member team group said five bodi lift rubbl rescuer continu look other britainbas opposit monitor group syrian observatori human right said number kill like rise search regim russia aircraft target oppositionheld area central hama provinc scene intens violenc recent week regim attempt push back opposit offens separ saturday regim armi said troop alli fighter repel attack daesh terrorist group strateg area held regim southern aleppo provinc attack took place khanas southeast aleppo strateg region link aleppo central western syria area chang hand mani time conflict last year regim forc alli fighter wrest control khanas daesh militari media arm said daesh attack um mayyal villag near mountain rang khanas area observatori said daesh fighter launch attack militari post area trigger intens clash leav mani casualti daeshaffili aamaq news agenc claim daesh fighter kill 30 regim soldier attack near capit hundr syrian oppositonheld suburb eastern ghouta near damascu protest infight insurg group began friday left dozen kill area infight came amid intensifi regim offens area near damascu opposit fighter control year increasingli squeez regim advanc god rid us leader protest chant critic head insurg group divert weapon front line regim infight pit power armi islam group alrahman corp alqaidalink group levant liber committe hayat tahrir alsham side blame trigger fight power struggl control eastern ghouta activist call armi islam rid eastern ghouta power alqaidalink group observatori said shot fire protest one area leav five injur 24 hour fight observatori said least 38 opposit fighter war side kill damascusbas shaam news network put number 60 addit six civilian kill clash past three year regim unabl regain control eastern suburb damascu recent week intensifi offens point new determin retak area saturday activist report heavi air campaign area qaboun neighborhood
1924058153,Airstrikes by Assad regime warplanes kill 4 in Syrias Idlib destroy mosque in Hama,"Published April 29 2017 At least four people were killed and 11 others were injured in airstrikes reportedly carried out by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. ""The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies"" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622. During his life he was a military commander in the Muslim-Quraysh Wars and during the Rashidun conquest of the Levant. He died of the plague in 639 and his tomb can be found in modern day Jordan.",dailysabah,4/16/2017,idlib,1,publish april 29 2017 least four peopl kill 11 other injur airstrik reportedli carri bashar alassad regim syria mosqu also destroy regim airstrik north hama westcentr region countri local civil defens sourc said friday civil defens offici idlib ley elfari told anadolu agenc four civilian kill seven other injur airstrik hit sermin district accord fari number residenti area destroy attack abu ubaidah ibn aljarrah mosqu north hama citi kafr zeita also destroy russian airstrik regim intens attack rural area idlib hama alli fari said video imag destroy mosqu circul onlin speak anadolu agenc yusuf elbustani local activist said regim forc attack oppositioncontrol qaboun neighborhood capit damascu bustani said four civilian injur attack ad local peopl difficulti meet basic need due regim forc attack east ghouta syria lock viciou civil war sinc earli 2011 assad regim crack prodemocraci protest unexpect feroc sever round peac talk geneva kazakh capit astana far fail end conflict hundr thousand syrian civilian believ kill date namesak destroy mosqu abu ubaidah ibn aljarrah one companion prophet muhammad convert islam 611 like mani earli muslim mecca abu ubaidah experienc hardship faith migrat abyssinia ethiopia deleg muhammad suggest abu ubaidah join muhammad prophet migrat mecca medina 622 life militari command muslimquraysh war rashidun conquest levant die plagu 639 tomb found modern day jordan
1924058155,Assad regime kills at least 75 in refugee camp,"Published October 31 2014 Activists in Syria reported that at least 75 people died from barrel bomb attacks carried out by the Syrian air force loyal to the Bashar Assad regime. The activists said some corpses were even beyond recognition. The bombs were dropped on a camp near al-Habeet in the northern province of Idlib on Wednesday killing mostly women and children at the camp. Footage posted on YouTube showed corpses of women and children and burning tents while people scrambled to save the wounded. ""Its a massacre of refugees"" a voice off camera said. ""Let the whole world see this they are displaced people. Look at them. They are civilians displaced civilians"" he said. The U.S. said it was ""horrified"" by the reports of the bombing adding that it could not confirm details. ""The attack on the Abedin camp was nothing short of barbaric"" said state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. ""Unfortunately if it is confirmed to be the work of the [Assad] regime it is only the latest act of brutality by the regime against its own people."" Camp residents told Reuters that the attack took place on Wednesday with two barrel bombs dropped from an army helicopter. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that the Assad regime carried out the air attack on the camp. U.S. officials acknowledged Wednesday that the solution to the crisis in Syria would ultimately require Assads removal even though coalition operations do not target his regime. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the solution in Syria will ""ultimately have to result in Assads departure."" She added ""You have an illegitimate and exceedingly violent leadership that has created conditions not only that have been so harmful to the population but have made it a very attractive magnet for terrorists"" while speaking at the Harman Center for the Arts based in Washington. Rices deputy Tony Blinken speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said that the train and equip program that the coalition will sponsor for moderate Syrian opposition fighters will also fight the Assad regime. Responding to a question as to why airstrikes do not target Assad forces that drop barrel bombs on civilians Blinken said the strategic plan of the coalition is to ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Blinken said the challenge for keeping the coalition is to deal with the different agendas that each country has. Blinken added in the end that the ""glue holding them together"" is ISISs violence. The war in Syria which started in March 2011 with pro-democracy protests but rapidly grew into a horrific civil war has caused the death of more than 200000 people and at least 60000 are missing. The war also displaced nearly 10 million people.

1924058165,School bombing kills 30 children in Syria monitor,"Published October 1 2014 They were among 39 people who died in the attack in the Akrameh neighbourhood according to a new toll from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""At least 30 children were among 39 people killed in the double bombing at the Akrameh al-Makhzumi school in Homs today"" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. One suicide attacker carried out both of the bombings. ""He planted a bomb at one location at the school and then blew himself up at another spot nearby"" Abdel Rahman told AFP. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. But Al-Qaedas branch in Syria Al-Nusra Front said it was behind a similar twin bombing in the central city that killed at least 12 people in May. Speaking to AFP on Wednesday Homs governor Talal al-Barazi had also reported the deadly attacks giving a toll of 31 killed and 74 wounded. The children were between six and nine years old he added. The toll is among the highest for children in suicide attacks across Syria since the conflict erupted in the country three years ago. In August 2013 a chemical attack on rebel areas in the outskirts of Damascus killed dozens of children and the year before 49 children were killed in the Houla ""massacre"" in Homs province.

1924058166,23 terrorists killed in N. Syria after Turkish artillery coalition jets pound Daesh targets - Daily Sabah,Published June 20 2016 At least 23 DAESH members were killed Sunday in northern Syria in a Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and U.S.-led coalition operation security sources said. Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9.

1924058169,Regime Russia air strikes kill 39 in Idlib as strikes continue to pound Road of death to Aleppo,"Published June 12 2016 At least 39 people were killed and dozens were injured in airstrikes launched by the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes in Syrias western province of Idlib on Sunday. A Syrian regime warplane struck a marketplace in the opposition-held province local civil defense official Leys al-Faris told Anadolu Agency. ""At least 36 people were killed and 50 others injured in the attack"" he said. Al-Faris described the attack as a ""massacre"" committed by the Bashar Assad regime during the fasting month of Ramadan which began in Syria last week. He said rescuers were struggling to extract people from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Meanwhile three people were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the city of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib. ""Rescuers are looking for survivors following the attack"" al-Faris said. Since April 21 Syrian regime forces and Russian warplanes have intensified attacks on opposition-held areas in Syria killings scores of civilians. This comes as the opposition-held sector of Syrias divided city of Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world in recent days by an escalation of air and artillery strikes on the only road in putting hundreds of thousands of people under effective siege. A regime campaign to fully capture Aleppo would most likely bury what little hope remains of reviving a diplomatic effort to end the five-year-old civil war after talks and a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia fell apart earlier this year. Aleppo Syrias largest city before the war when it had more than 2 million people has been divided for years into opposition and government sectors and capturing all of it has been one of Bashar Assads biggest goals. An estimated 350000 people are still thought to live in the opposition sector in harsh conditions made worse by the latest attempt to besiege them by cutting off the last remaining route out the Castello Road named for Aleppos old castle. ""The regime was not able to cut the road by land so it has decided to keep the planes in the sky continuously hitting everything that passes regardless of what it is"" said Zakaria Malahifji senior official in the Aleppo opposition group Fastaqim. ""Whoever wants to go on the Castello road is undertaking a suicide mission"" he said. ""Its been this way for 10 or 12 days. The situation was difficult before - it was targeted and people were crossing with difficulty - but now it is almost cut nobody dares to use it"" he said speaking at his groups office in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. The international focus in Syria in recent weeks has partly turned towards the conflict with Islamic State fighters as both the government and its enemies have made gains at the expense of the ultra-hardline Islamist militants on several fronts. But the separate hope of foreign powers - that the wider civil war could also be resolved - has broken down with Aleppo potentially the biggest battlefield of all. Hundreds of people have been killed there since peace talks broke off. Assad vowed in a speech last week to recapture ""every inch"" of Syria. Aleppo he said would be a ""graveyard"" for the ambitions of his regional foe Turkish President Tayyip Erdoan who has backed opposition groups. A pro-Damascus source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the reference was a signal of his intentions ""Why this threat? Because there are preparations for something big in Aleppo."" So far pro-regime ground forces aided by Iranian and Lebanese Shiite militias have been unable to complete the encirclement of Aleppo by capturing a narrow corridor of territory through which the Castello Road passes. The highway had long been under sniper fire but attacks from the air and artillery sharply increased less than two weeks ago with more planes flying and new rockets and guns moved into range. ""Castello is the road to death to Aleppo. I did not know whether I would make it to Aleppo city alive"" said Mohamad Adeeb an opposition activist who drove the road on Friday. ""I saw death with my own eyes with corpses lying on the way and dozens of trucks and civilian cars and bodies that none of the civil defence teams were able to recover because of the intensity of the shelling of the regime and Russian warplanes."" Inside Aleppo the new pressure on the road has driven up prices of goods adding to the suffering of those still there. The Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights says more than 300 people have been killed in air strikes and government bombardment of opposition-held Aleppo since April. Opposition sources say the toll is much higher with dozens of people currently being killed each day in eastern Aleppo one of the bloodiest spells it has suffered in the conflict. Civil defence emergency workers operating in opposition-held areas say more than 450 people were killed there in the last month. ""It is a difficult and dangerous period we are going through. Aleppo is almost under siege"" Abu Yassine said. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people.",dailysabah,6/15/2016,idlib,1,publish june 12 2016 least 39 peopl kill dozen injur airstrik launch syrian regim russian warplan syria western provinc idlib sunday syrian regim warplan struck marketplac oppositionheld provinc local civil defens offici ley alfari told anadolu agenc least 36 peopl kill 50 other injur attack said alfari describ attack massacr commit bashar assad regim fast month ramadan began syria last week said rescuer struggl extract peopl rubbl destroy build meanwhil three peopl kill russian airstrik residenti area citi maaret alnuman idlib rescuer look survivor follow attack alfari said sinc april 21 syrian regim forc russian warplan intensifi attack oppositionheld area syria kill score civilian come oppositionheld sector syria divid citi aleppo cut outsid world recent day escal air artilleri strike road put hundr thousand peopl effect sieg regim campaign fulli captur aleppo would like buri littl hope remain reviv diplomat effort end fiveyearold civil war talk ceasefir sponsor unit state russia fell apart earlier year aleppo syria largest citi war 2 million peopl divid year opposit govern sector captur one bashar assad biggest goal estim 350000 peopl still thought live opposit sector harsh condit made wors latest attempt besieg cut last remain rout castello road name aleppo old castl regim abl cut road land decid keep plane sky continu hit everyth pass regardless said zakaria malahifji senior offici aleppo opposit group fastaqim whoever want go castello road undertak suicid mission said way 10 12 day situat difficult target peopl cross difficulti almost cut nobodi dare use said speak group offic turkish citi gaziantep near syrian border intern focu syria recent week partli turn toward conflict islam state fighter govern enemi made gain expens ultrahardlin islamist milit sever front separ hope foreign power wider civil war could also resolv broken aleppo potenti biggest battlefield hundr peopl kill sinc peac talk broke assad vow speech last week recaptur everi inch syria aleppo said would graveyard ambit region foe turkish presid tayyip erdoan back opposit group prodamascu sourc spoke condit anonym said refer signal intent threat prepar someth big aleppo far proregim ground forc aid iranian lebanes shiit militia unabl complet encircl aleppo captur narrow corridor territori castello road pass highway long sniper fire attack air artilleri sharpli increas less two week ago plane fli new rocket gun move rang castello road death aleppo know whether would make aleppo citi aliv said mohamad adeeb opposit activist drove road friday saw death eye corps lie way dozen truck civilian car bodi none civil defenc team abl recov intens shell regim russian warplan insid aleppo new pressur road driven price good ad suffer still syrian obervatori human right say 300 peopl kill air strike govern bombard oppositionheld aleppo sinc april opposit sourc say toll much higher dozen peopl current kill day eastern aleppo one bloodiest spell suffer conflict civil defenc emerg worker oper oppositionheld area say 450 peopl kill last month difficult danger period go aleppo almost sieg abu yassin said syria lock viciou civil war sinc earli 2011 assad regim crack prodemocraci protest unexpect feroc sinc quarter million peopl kill 10 million displac across warbatt countri accord un syrian center polici research howev put death toll sixyear conflict 470000 peopl
1924058170,Daesh claims responsibility for bombings near Damascus at least 20 dead,Published June 11 2016 Suicide bombers struck outside a Shiite shrine near Syrias capital Saturday leaving at least 20 people dead a monitor said in an attack claimed by the Daesh group. The official SANA news agency said two suicide bombers one in a car attacked the entrance to the Sayyida Zeinab shrine which is revered by Shiites around the world. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a British-based monitoring group said at least 20 people were killed including 13 civilians and more than 30 wounded in the blasts. SANA gave a toll of at least 12 dead and 55 wounded. Daesh claimed the attack via its Amaq news agency saying it was carried out by three suicide bombers. The shrine around 10 kilometres (six miles) south of the centre of Damascus is heavily guarded by pro-government forces but has still been the target of several attacks including those claimed by the Daesh terrorist group. Syrias official Al-Ikhbariya channel showed images from the scene of burned-out cars billowing with plumes of black smoke. Firefighters battled to extinguish the flames as shop signs lay in the street. The last attack on Sayyida Zeinab on April 25 killed at least seven and wounded dozens.

1924058172,At least 44 killed dozens injured as twin bombing targets Syrias Qamishli near Turkish border,"Published July 27 2016 A twin bombing struck a crowd in a predominantly Kurdish town in northern Syria on Wednesday killing 44 people and wounding dozens more Syrias state-run news agency and Kurdish media reported. The Daesh group claimed responsibility for the attack. Media reports said a truck loaded with large quantities of explosives blew up on the western edge of the town of Qamishli followed by an explosives-packed motorcycle a few minutes later in the same area. The blasts caused massive damage in the area and rescue teams were working to recover victims from under the rubble the SANA news agency said. This photo captured from the town of Nusaybin near the Turkish side of the border shows plume of smoke occurred after the explosion. (IHA Photo) Qamishli near the Turkish border is mainly controlled by PYD but Syrian regime forces are present and control the towns airport. Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars. Qamishli resident Suleiman Youssef a writer told The Associated Press by telephone that he heard the first explosion from few miles away. He said the blasts leveled several buildings to the ground and many people were trapped under the rubble. ""Most of the buildings at the scene of the explosion have been heavily damaged because of the strength of the blast"" he said. The Daesh group in a statement published by its affiliated Aamaq news agency said it carried out the attack in Qamishli describing it as a truck bombing that struck a complex of Kurdish offices. The terrorist group has carried out several bombings in Kurdish areas in Syria in the past. The PYD-dominated and U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces have been the main force fighting Daesh in northern Syria capturing significant territory from the terrorists over the past two years.

1924058173,Coalition airstrikes kill 85 civilians in Daesh-held villages in Syrias Manbij,Published July 19 2016 Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.,dailysabah,7/6/2016,aleppo,0,publish juli 19 2016 airstrik daeshheld villag northern syria kill least 85 civilian tuesday intens fight underway milit usback fighter syrian opposit activist extremist group said resid area blame usl coalit strike target two villag tokhar hoshariyeh control activist said villag near daesh stronghold manbij town member pyddomin usback syria democrat forc sdf tri captur weekslong offens britainbas syrian observatori human right said least 56 civilian includ 11 children kill strike villag also wound dozen anoth activist group local coordin committe said dozen civilian mostli famili kill turkey offici anadolu agenc put death toll least 85 ad 50 civilian also wound airstrik daeshlink aamaq news agenc claim 160 civilian mostli women children kill tokhar alon seri purportedli american airstrik around dawn tuesday post facebook page show imag peopl includ children put collect grave purportedli villag tokhar one photograph show man carri lifeless bodi child cover dust anoth show child partli cover blanket lie grave tuesday casualti come heel similar airstrik daeshheld town manbij monday least 15 civilian reportedli kill meanwhil headquart daesh milit insid manbij captur sdf forc push western part town weekend us militari said statement tuesday headquart locat hospit use command center logist hub usback syrian rebel also took control part town enabl civilian area flee fight statement said rebel continu battl daesh four front control manbij clear territori push toward center citi statement said daesh milit stage counterattack syrian rebel maintain momentum help air strike usl coalit statement said said coalit carri 450 air strike around manbij sinc oper take town began us central command said coalit conduct 18 strike monday destroy 13 daesh fight posit seven daesh vehicl two car bomb near manbij manbij area seen intens battl daesh extremist kurdishl fighter advanc cover intens airstrik usl coalit manbij captur usback fighter biggest strateg defeat daesh syria sinc juli 2015 extremist group lost border town tal abyad neighbor iraq meanwhil daesh beaten back sever front iraqi forc aid usl coalit airstrik retaken citi ramadi fallujah western anbar provinc

The attack which also wounded dozens of people occurred in the neighbourhood of Salihiah ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festival.

The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force.

1924058178,25 children killed in airstrikes in eastern Syria in latest round of Russian Syrian bombing UNICEF,"Published June 27 2016 A day after it was announced that Russian and Syrian regime airstrikes killed 58 civilians in eastern Syria UNICEF said 25 casualties were children Twenty-five children were reportedly killed in airstrikes that hit heavily crowded areas in a town in eastern Syria UNICEF has said. Quoting reports from its local partners in Syria UNICEF said health workers were reported to have pulled bodies of children from under rubble in the town of al-Quria in Deir ez-Zor province which is mostly under DAESH control. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported on Saturday that air strikes carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes killed dozens of people in al-Quria. Deir ez-Zor province links DAESHs de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa with territory it controls in Iraq. ""Three attacks reportedly hit heavily crowded areas including a mosque during prayer time"" UNICEF said in a statement. ""UNICEF deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to the conflict to keep children out of harms way."" On Sunday a monitor said at least 82 people including 58 civilians were killed during airstrikes launched by Russia and Bashar Assads regime on the DAESH-held area of eastern Syria. ""Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir ez-Zor city killed 58 civilians"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH extremists. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir e-Zzor the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the extremist-held Raqqa province. Last week the Syrian opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) called on U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to launch an investigation into their assertions that Russia has repeatedly used air-delivered incendiary weapons against civilians in Syria. ""Russian air forces have repeatedly deployed incendiary weapons and cluster munitions to kill main and terrorize Syrian civilians including in at least 10 documented incidents"" Riad Hijab coordinator of the opposition HNC wrote to Ban. ""They have violated the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and breached international humanitarian law"" he wrote. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests which erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Russia first began its air campaign in Syria on Sept. 30 of last year. While Russia claims its campaign is aimed primarily at the DAESH terrorist group it has repeatedly targeted civilian areas and the moderate anti-regime opposition groups that control them. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced throughout the war-battered country according to the U.N. The Syrian Center for Policy Research a nongovernmental organization however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000. Watchdog Thousands tortured to death by Syrian regime Meanwhile a human rights group said more than 12000 people have been tortured to death by the Syrian regime since 2011. In a Sunday statement the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said that 12679 people died of torture from March 2011 to June 2016. ""The Syrian regime is responsible for 99 percent of deaths due to torture at detention centers"" the statement added which was issued to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. SNHR Director Fadl Abdel-Ghani said his group could not document any case of detention with a legal warrant. ""The regime has committed crimes against humanity"" he said citing sexual assault killing and involuntary disappearance as some of the practices by the Syrian regime. Last month The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that at least 60000 people have died in Syrian government jails during the five-year conflict. He said more than 20000 of them had died at Sednaya prison near Damascus. The observatory said it had been able to verify the deaths of 14456 people 110 of them under the age of 18 since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. ""We know large numbers of people have died in detention in Syria"" said Nadim Houry deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch in a telephone interview. A Syrian defector known as Caesar in 2013 smuggled out tens of thousands of photos taken between May 2011 and August 2013 that show at least 6786 separate individuals who had died in government custody HRW said in a report issued in December. That toll was calculated by the Syrian Association for Missing and Conscience Detainees (SAFMCD) which was formed by an opposition body and reviewed all the photos the HRW report said.

1924058189,Daesh mines killed wounded dozens in YPG-held Manbij HRW says,"Published October 26 2016 A leading international rights group says that homemade land mines planted by the Daesh terrorist group have killed and wounded hundreds of civilians including dozens of children in a town recently freed of the militants in northern Syria. Human Rights Watch says in a report issued Wednesday that it collected the names of 69 civilians killed including 19 children by improvised mines in schools homes and on roads in Manbij during a five-day investigation this month. The victims were killed during and after the fighting for control of the town. Ole Solvang deputy emergencies director at the New York-based group says Daesh ""mined virtually everything including quite literally the kitchen sink before they left."" Forces of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dominated by PKK terrorist organizations Syrian offshoot PYDs armed wing YPG (Peoples Protection Units) took Manbij from Daesh in August after a two-month-long siege over the period of two years after the terrorists moved in. Turkey has voiced reservations in YPG moving into Manbij which has a predominantly Arab population.

1924058191,Aleppo airstrikes kill 36 people in opposition-held areas,"Published October 17 2016 Airstrikes on opposition-held areas in the northern province of Aleppo Monday killed at least 36 people including children opposition activists said as violence in Syria continued while a major operation began against Daesh in neighboring Iraq. Most of the deaths were in the village of Oweijel just west of the city of Aleppo where at least 23 people were killed in an airstrike that also wounded dozens according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Another monitoring group the Local Coordination Committees said the air raid was carried out by Russian warplanes and put the death toll at 30. More than a dozen people were also killed in a besieged eastern opposition-held neighborhood in Aleppo. The eastern parts of the city Syrias largest have been subjected in recent weeks to the worst aerial attacks in years. The airstrikes have claimed hundreds of lives wounded many others and demolished entire buildings. Opposition activists have blamed Russian and Syrian government warplanes for the strikes. The Observatory said Mondays airstrikes hit in the Marjeh neighborhood. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said those killed included 11 people with the same family name of Qabs ranging from a month-and-a-half-old baby girl to a 25-year-old man. Mondays airstrikes coincided with the launch in neighboring Iraq of a major operation by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh. There have been concerns the government in Damascus could use the timing of the Mosul offensive to press its onslaught in Aleppo while world attention is diverted to developments in Iraq. Also Monday Syrian state media claimed 49 oppostion fighters were killed and wounded in fighting in the neighborhoods of Sheikh Saeed and Shurfa on the southern edges of Aleppo. In the nearby province of Idlib a U.S.-led coalition drone struck a car in the provincial capital that carries the same name killing all inside according to the Observatory official. It was not immediately clear who was in the vehicle but such attacks have previously targeted officials with al-Qaidas affiliate in Syria known as Fatah al-Sham Front. The Observatory said the attack targeted a faction commander. An official with Fatah al-Sham Front formerly known as Nusra Front said all those in the car were ""martyred."" The man who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said it was not clear if members of his group were targeted. Earlier this month a drone attack killed top al-Qaida official Ahmed Salama Mabrouk. The United States and Britain on Sunday acknowledged the Western worlds weak support for any military action against Syrias government as they seek ways to pressure Syrian regime leader Bashar Assad and his chief backer Russia to halt the deadly Aleppo offensive. After a meeting of 11 governments opposing Assads rule U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson each insisted that all options were on the table. But their stark explanations about the danger of resorting to military force appeared to rule out such a move. The government in Damascus meanwhile appears to be trying to improve relations with Egypt the Arab worlds most populous nation following the first public meeting between Egyptian and Syrian security chiefs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk head of the National Security Bureau and one of Assads top aides visited Cairo Sunday at the head of a delegation to coordinate with Egypt in the fight against ""terrorism"" in the region Syrias state-run news agency SANA said. SANA said the Syrians met with top intelligence officials including deputy chief of Egypts intelligence agency. It said both sides agreed on ""coordinating political standpoints"" and strengthening the ""cooperation in fighting terrorism."" Egypts pro-government Sada al-Balad and other news websites reported on Sunday that six Syrians arrived on a private jet from Damascus. Earlier this month Egypt voted for rival French and Russian draft resolutions on Syria at the U.N. Security Council arguing that both called for a truce and for aid for besieged Syrians in the rebel-held areas of the northern city of Aleppo.

1924058192,11 killed 25 injured in Russian air strike in Syrias Idlib,"Published October 15 2016 At least 11 people were killed and 25 others injured Saturday when Russian fighter jets struck an opposition-held neighborhood in western Syrias Idlib province according to a local civil defense official. The Russian strike targeted a drug warehouse and a civil defense center in Turmanin neighborhood Vasik Harak told Anadolu Agency. He said the raid has left a number of houses destroyed and caused a fire but fire fighters managed to put it out. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however a Beirut-based NGO has put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000.",dailysabah,10/4/2016,idlib,1,publish octob 15 2016 least 11 peopl kill 25 other injur saturday russian fighter jet struck oppositionheld neighborhood western syria idlib provinc accord local civil defens offici russian strike target drug warehous civil defens center turmanin neighborhood vasik harak told anadolu agenc said raid left number hous destroy caus fire fire fighter manag put syria lock viciou civil war sinc earli 2011 bashar alassad regim crack prodemocraci protest erupt part arab spring upris unexpect feroc sinc quarter million peopl kill 10 million displac across warbatt countri accord un syrian center polici research howev beirutbas ngo put death toll sixyear conflict 470000
1924058193,Death toll rises in Aleppo while British FM blames Russia,"Published October 12 2016 Activists say the death toll in rebel-held Aleppo in Syria continues to rise with at least 27 dead on Tuesday as the Assad forces push to weed out rebels. Russia meanwhile faces what Kremlin officials call Russophobia after British FM Johnson called public protests at its London embassy over airstrikes in Aleppo Casualties pile up in Syrias Aleppo controlled by rebels as the forces loyal to the Assad regime push to recapture it with the aid of Russian airstrikes. Russias assistance meanwhile continues to draw the ire of Europe with the latest salvo from British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson who called for ""picketing"" at the Russian embassy in London. At least 15 people were killed in fresh air strikes and artillery fire on rebel-held areas of Syrias Aleppo on Wednesday a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was expected to rise due to the number of wounded that are in serious condition. The Britain-based monitor said among the areas hit in the bombardment was a market in the neighborhood of Fardos. The deaths come a day after Russia stepped up its air raids on east Aleppo in support of an army operation to recapture the rebel-held sector of the city. The Tuesday raids killed at least 27 people among them four children in several districts including Fardos according to the Observatory. Four people were also killed and 14 wounded during rebel fire in government-held west Aleppo on Tuesday. Among those who survived the Tuesday strikes in the district of Fardos was 13-year-old Jameel Mustafa Habbush who was dug out of the rubble in a four-hour operation by the White Helmets rescue workers. An AFP photographer at the scene said rescuers heard Habbush shouting from under the rubble and began digging towards him. As they worked to free him they administered oxygen clamping a mask to his face as he emerged from the debris. His father and younger brother were reportedly killed in the attack and his mother was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011. In late September the army announced an operation to recapture the rebel-held east Aleppo after the collapse of a short-lived truce. Since then more than 300 people have been killed in bombardments of rebel-held areas according to the Observatory. British foreign minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called for anti-war campaigners to protest outside the Russian embassy in London during a parliamentary debate on the bombing of Aleppo in Syria. ""Id certainly like to see demonstrations outside the Russian embassy"" Johnson told MPs in the parliament. Johnson the former mayor of London known for his many public gaffes said the ""wells of outrage are growing exhausted"" and anti-war groups were not expressing sufficient outrage at the conflict in Aleppo. ""Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where are they?"" he said. The Stop the War group was co-founded by current opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to protest against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It brought millions of Britons into the streets to protest against the build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. During Tuesdays debate in parliament several lawmakers accused Russia of committing war crimes in Syria. Johnson was responding to a question from Labour member of parliament Ann Clwyd who called for protests by millions of people outside Russian embassies worldwide. ""I would therefore call once again on everyone who cares about the plight of Syrian civilians to picket the Russian embassy in London and in capitals around the world from today"" she said. ""Two million three million four million people. It can be done. It has been done in the past."" Andrew Mitchell a former international development minister said British aircraft could help enforce a no-fly zone to prevent Russian bombing raids. ""The international community has an avowed responsibility to protect and that protection must be exerted"" the member of parliament from Prime Minister Theresa Mays governing Conservative Party said. ""If that means confronting Russian airpower defensively on behalf of the innocent people on the ground who we are trying to protect then we should do that."" Mitchell compared Russias actions to those of Nazi forces during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. Russia has been waging a punishing aerial bombing campaign in Syria for more than a year in support of President Bashar al-Assads forces part of a multi-front war that has claimed some 300000 lives and seen Moscow further estranged from the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday cancelled a visit to France in a furious row over Moscows role in the Syrian conflict. The announcement from the Kremlin came a day after French President Francois Hollande said Syrian forces had committed a ""war crime"" in the battered city of Aleppo with the support of Russian air strikes. Moscow yesterday hit out at Johnson for accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Syria dismissing his comments as ""Russophobic hysteria."" Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Johnsons ""accusing Russia of all mortal sins"" was just a ""storm in a teacup."" ""The Russophobic hysteria that is regularly fueled by certain members of the British establishment has not been taken seriously for a long time"" he said. Konashenkov said the Russian air force was not responsible for the bombing of a U.N. convoy in the Aleppo region last month and accused Britain of withholding the evidence it says it has against Russia. ""The alleged evidence you say you have wont be worth a penny if it is made available to everyone"" he said. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Tuesday that Moscow was ""truly ashamed for"" Johnson over his comments.",dailysabah,10/7/2016,aleppo,1,publish octob 12 2016 activist say death toll rebelheld aleppo syria continu rise least 27 dead tuesday assad forc push weed rebel russia meanwhil face kremlin offici call russophobia british fm johnson call public protest london embassi airstrik aleppo casualti pile syria aleppo control rebel forc loyal assad regim push recaptur aid russian airstrik russia assist meanwhil continu draw ire europ latest salvo british foreign minist bori johnson call picket russian embassi london least 15 peopl kill fresh air strike artilleri fire rebelheld area syria aleppo wednesday monitor said syrian observatori human right said death toll expect rise due number wound seriou condit britainbas monitor said among area hit bombard market neighborhood fardo death come day russia step air raid east aleppo support armi oper recaptur rebelheld sector citi tuesday raid kill least 27 peopl among four children sever district includ fardo accord observatori four peopl also kill 14 wound rebel fire governmentheld west aleppo tuesday among surviv tuesday strike district fardo 13yearold jameel mustafa habbush dug rubbl fourhour oper white helmet rescu worker afp photograph scene said rescuer heard habbush shout rubbl began dig toward work free administ oxygen clamp mask face emerg debri father younger brother reportedli kill attack mother taken hospit seriou injuri syria econom powerhous aleppo ravag conflict began antigovern protest march 2011 late septemb armi announc oper recaptur rebelheld east aleppo collaps shortliv truce sinc 300 peopl kill bombard rebelheld area accord observatori british foreign minist bori johnson tuesday call antiwar campaign protest outsid russian embassi london parliamentari debat bomb aleppo syria id certainli like see demonstr outsid russian embassi johnson told mp parliament johnson former mayor london known mani public gaff said well outrag grow exhaust antiwar group express suffici outrag conflict aleppo stop war coalit moment said stop war group cofound current opposit labour parti leader jeremi corbyn protest war afghanistan iraq brought million briton street protest buildup invas iraq 2003 tuesday debat parliament sever lawmak accus russia commit war crime syria johnson respond question labour member parliament ann clwyd call protest million peopl outsid russian embassi worldwid would therefor call everyon care plight syrian civilian picket russian embassi london capit around world today said two million three million four million peopl done done past andrew mitchel former intern develop minist said british aircraft could help enforc nofli zone prevent russian bomb raid intern commun avow respons protect protect must exert member parliament prime minist theresa may govern conserv parti said mean confront russian airpow defens behalf innoc peopl ground tri protect mitchel compar russia action nazi forc spanish civil war 1930 russia wage punish aerial bomb campaign syria year support presid bashar alassad forc part multifront war claim 300000 live seen moscow estrang west russian presid vladimir putin tuesday cancel visit franc furiou row moscow role syrian conflict announc kremlin came day french presid francoi holland said syrian forc commit war crime batter citi aleppo support russian air strike moscow yesterday hit johnson accus russia commit war crime syria dismiss comment russophob hysteria russian defens ministri spokesman igor konashenkov said statement johnson accus russia mortal sin storm teacup russophob hysteria regularli fuel certain member british establish taken serious long time said konashenkov said russian air forc respons bomb un convoy aleppo region last month accus britain withhold evid say russia alleg evid say wont worth penni made avail everyon said russian foreign ministri spokeswoman maria zakharova said tuesday moscow truli asham johnson comment

1924058196,14 killed in suicide attack on Syria wedding,Published October 3 2016 At least 14 people were killed 25 were wounded in suicide attack on a wedding in Hasakah northern Syria late Monday. A police source in the city said the initial toll also included 55 injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 were killed in the blast adding the number was expected to rise with many of the wounded in critical condition. The city is mainly in the hands of the PKKs Syrian wing the YPG after it evicted the Syrian regime army last August and leaving them with a symbolic foothold in a security zone in the center of the city. The YPG have expanded their control of the city despite the bombing of several locations by Syrian jets. Thousands of civilians in the ethnically mixed city including members of the Christian community have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified. Hasakahs population swelled by displaced Syrians fleeing areas that fell under Daish control is broadly divided along ethnic lines with Kurds mainly in the citys eastern neighborhoods and Arabs in the southern parts. Ankara has frequently voiced its concern over YPG activity along the Turkish border and has been rigid in its stance to not allow the PYD militant group to found any de facto Kurdish state in northern Syria.

1924058197,21 moderate opposition fighters killed in clashes with Daish in northern Syria,Published October 3 2016 21 Syrian moderate opposition fighters have been killed in clashes with the Daish terrorist organization in the last 24 hours in Syria on Monday where Turkish backed-moderate groups launched a major military operation to liberate the towns from terrorists. Another 30 moderate fighters were injured due to the latest clashes. Turkish backed-moderate groups hit 63 Daish targets after determining them via surveillance devices on Monday. Several weapons equipment six full armed pick-up like vehicles a supplies-laden truck seven Katyusha rocket launchers three settlements all of which belonged to the Daish terrorist organization were destroyed in the operation. Turkish warplanes carried out airstrikes against Daish in the area of Akhtarin Turkmen Bari and Dabiq of northern Syria and destroyed nine Daish targets with ten bombs. Nine buildings used by the terrorists as a base for command head weapon emplacement and an ammunition depot were also destroyed. Meanwhile moderate groups organized 11 airstrike operations against Daish in the area of Ziyadiyah Bahrutah Duvaybik Aktharin and Turkmen Bari in northern Syria. 13 elements of the terrorist group including four buildings three vehicles and a mortar were destroyed. On Sunday three rockets fired from a Daish-controlled area in Syria hit the border city of Kilis one police officer killed and two injured. Turkish howitzers responded with artillery fire to the rockets military sources said. An area of 960 square kilometers in northern Syria have been taken under control so far in the counter-terror operation called Operations Euphrates Shield that was started by Turkish backed-Syrian moderate groups on August 24 to secure the northern Syria from regional terror groups such as the PKKs Syrian branches the PYD YPG and Daish.

1924058200,At least 23 killed in regime strikes in Aleppo as UN meets over Syria,"Published September 25 2016 At least 23 civilians have been killed in renewed regime airstrikes on the contested city of Aleppo Syrian activists said Sunday as France and Britains Foreign Ministers raised the prospect of investigating Russia for war crimes ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about the spiraling violence in Syria. Medical workers and local officials reported airstrikes on neighborhoods throughout Aleppos opposition-held eastern districts as an announced regime offensive entered its fourth day. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 23 civilians had been killed by 6 p.m. and said it expects the toll to rise. Ibrahim Alhaj of the Syrian Civil Defense search and rescue outfit said hospitals and rescuers have documented the deaths of 43 people so far. Hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties and medical workers are expecting many of the wounded to die from a lack of treatment according to Mohammad Zein Khandaqani a member of the Medical Council which oversees medical affairs in the opposition areas. ""Ive never seen so many people dying in once place"" he said from a hospital in the city. ""Its terrifying today. In less than one hour the Russian planes have killed more than 50 people and injured more than 200."" The Observatory which relies on a network of contacts inside Syria said earlier in the day that 213 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and shelling on opposition areas in and around Aleppo since a U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire collapsed Monday evening. At the U.N. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russia should be investigated for war crimes following an attack on a Syrian aid convoy that claimed 20 lives Monday. Johnson said that Russias air force may have deliberately targeted the civilian convoy on Sept. 19. Russia denies involvement and instead suggests the Syrian opposition or a U.S. drone were responsible. Frances Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran will be guilty of war crimes if they dont pressure Bashar Assad to stop escalating violence. Ayrault said an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting Sunday is a ""moment of truth"" for the U.N. The meeting was requested by the United States Britain and France as pro-regime forces extend their bombardment of the contested city of Aleppo. They are widely believed to be accompanied by Russian air strikes. Assad has rallied Syrias minorities behind his regime behind fears of a Sunni-dominated rebellion. The U.S. Britain and France are aligned on the Security Council against Russia and China which back Assad in the countrys protracted war now in its sixth year. But a broad coalition of Syrian rebels denounced international negotiations for peace as ""meaningless"" earlier Sunday. The statement released jointly by 33 factions called on the government and Russian forces to halt airstrikes and lift sieges on opposition areas. The U.N. estimates 600000 Syrians are trapped in various sieges enforced by the regime and Daesht across the country. ""Negotiations under the present conditions are no longer useful and are meaningless"" the statement said. The factions said they would not accept to have Russia mediate any negotiations calling it a ""partner to the regime in the crimes against our people."" The statement was signed by some of the largest factions from across Syria but did not include the powerful ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham nor the al-Qaida-linked Fatah Sham Front. Efforts to revive the truce have floundered. An airstrike destroyed a U.N.-backed humanitarian convoy Monday inside opposition territory shortly after the Syrian regime military announced the agreement had expired. The U.N. says the attack could amount to a war crime if proven deliberate though it has not assigned responsibility yet. The U.S. says it believes Russian jets were behind the strikes. The opposition Sunday retook an area in Aleppo that fell to regime forces the day before extending a punishing stalemate in the contested northern city. The Observatory says the opposition seized Handarat a largely uninhabited former Palestinian refugee camp early Sunday a day after it was lost to government forces. The camp has changed hands multiple times and is largely devastated and abandoned. The area is near Castello Road a vital supply route to the citys besieged opposition-held areas. Regime forces seized the Castello Road earlier this year besieging opposition-held districts where some 250000 people reside.",dailysabah,9/6/2016,aleppo,0,publish septemb 25 2016 least 23 civilian kill renew regim airstrik contest citi aleppo syrian activist said sunday franc britain foreign minist rais prospect investig russia war crime ahead emerg un secur council meet spiral violenc syria medic worker local offici report airstrik neighborhood throughout aleppo oppositionheld eastern district announc regim offens enter fourth day britainbas syrian observatori human right report 23 civilian kill 6 pm said expect toll rise ibrahim alhaj syrian civil defens search rescu outfit said hospit rescuer document death 43 peopl far hospit overwhelm casualti medic worker expect mani wound die lack treatment accord mohammad zein khandaqani member medic council overse medic affair opposit area ive never seen mani peopl die place said hospit citi terrifi today less one hour russian plane kill 50 peopl injur 200 observatori reli network contact insid syria said earlier day 213 civilian kill airstrik shell opposit area around aleppo sinc usrussian broker ceasefir collaps monday even un british foreign secretari bori johnson said russia investig war crime follow attack syrian aid convoy claim 20 live monday johnson said russia air forc may deliber target civilian convoy sept 19 russia deni involv instead suggest syrian opposit us drone respons franc foreign minist jeanmarc ayrault said russia iran guilti war crime dont pressur bashar assad stop escal violenc ayrault said emerg unit nation secur council meet sunday moment truth un meet request unit state britain franc proregim forc extend bombard contest citi aleppo wide believ accompani russian air strike assad ralli syria minor behind regim behind fear sunnidomin rebellion us britain franc align secur council russia china back assad countri protract war sixth year broad coalit syrian rebel denounc intern negoti peac meaningless earlier sunday statement releas jointli 33 faction call govern russian forc halt airstrik lift sieg opposit area un estim 600000 syrian trap variou sieg enforc regim daesht across countri negoti present condit longer use meaningless statement said faction said would accept russia mediat negoti call partner regim crime peopl statement sign largest faction across syria includ power ultraconserv ahrar alsham alqaidalink fatah sham front effort reviv truce flounder airstrik destroy unback humanitarian convoy monday insid opposit territori shortli syrian regim militari announc agreement expir un say attack could amount war crime proven deliber though assign respons yet us say believ russian jet behind strike opposit sunday retook area aleppo fell regim forc day extend punish stalem contest northern citi observatori say opposit seiz handarat larg uninhabit former palestinian refuge camp earli sunday day lost govern forc camp chang hand multipl time larg devast abandon area near castello road vital suppli rout citi besieg oppositionheld area regim forc seiz castello road earlier year besieg oppositionheld district 250000 peopl resid
1924058201,Assad regime strikes kill 92 civilians in Syrias Aleppo,"Published September 24 2016 Ninety-two civilians were killed and 273 others injured Saturday by Assad regime and Russian airstrikes on residential areas in opposition-held parts of Syrias northwestern city of Aleppo a civil defense official said. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Najib Ansari said the warplanes targeted the districts of Bustan al-Qasr Mashhad al-Kallasa Salihiya and al-Fardos Sheikh Haider Ansar Bustan al-Basha Ard al-Hamra Sohr Tariq al-Bab Karam Hamud Mesir all of which were currently under siege by the Assad regime. The casualties include women and children. The death toll is expected to rise further due to the limited capacity to rescue victims trapped under collapsed buildings. On Friday 86 people were killed by regime and Russian warplanes. Aleppo has recently come under intense attacks by regime and Russian forces. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is ""appalled by the chilling military escalation"" in the Syrian city of Aleppo his spokesman said on Saturday. ""Since the announcement two days ago by the Assad regime of an offensive to capture eastern Aleppo there have been repeated reports of airstrikes involving the use of incendiary weapons and advanced munitions such as bunker buster bombs"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

The town population has swelled with the arrival of Syrians fleeing from the fighting elsewhere in the countrys north. Atarabs market drew not just the townspeople but also shoppers from the countryside and nearby villages. ""You can see the body fragments in the rubble"" said Yasser Hmeish a medical technician at the scene.

He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment.

1926479015,Silence over Russias Crimes Serves Its Goal of Undermining Political Solution,Monday 11 January 2016 18:41 Silence over Russias Crimes Serves Its Goal of Undermining Political Solution. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemned the heinous massacre carried out by Russian warplanes in which 35 civilians mostly schoolchildren and teachers were killed and many more wounded. Three schools were targeted by Russian aircrafts earlier this morning in the town of Ain Jara in rural Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the international community must act quickly against Russias flagrant crimes against the Syrian people including children women and the elderly. Russias actions in Syria while representing a continuation of Assads terror since the start of Syrian revolution are designed to break the will of the Syrian people and undermine the political solution. The Syrian Coalition reiterated that this crime and other crimes by the Assad regime and its allies represent a clear violation of UN Security Council resolution 2254 which calls for immediate cessation of all attacks against civilians. The silence of the international community over the crimes of the Assad regime and its allies against Syrian civilians as well as its complete disregard for their blood is a shameful stain on humanity. The failure to explicitly and clearly condemn the Russian aggression and the inaction towards Russias massacres against the Syrian people constitute outright support for these crimes. This silence also represents complicity in undermining efforts to find a political solution in Syria the Syrian Coalition added.,etilaf,1/11/2016,aleppo,0,monday 11 januari 2016 1841 silenc russia crime serv goal undermin polit solut syrian coalit strongli condemn heinou massacr carri russian warplan 35 civilian mostli schoolchildren teacher kill mani wound three school target russian aircraft earlier morn town jara rural aleppo syrian coalit stress intern commun must act quickli russia flagrant crime syrian peopl includ children women elderli russia action syria repres continu assad terror sinc start syrian revolut design break syrian peopl undermin polit solut syrian coalit reiter crime crime assad regim alli repres clear violat un secur council resolut 2254 call immedi cessat attack civilian silenc intern commun crime assad regim alli syrian civilian well complet disregard blood shame stain human failur explicitli clearli condemn russian aggress inact toward russia massacr syrian peopl constitut outright support crime silenc also repres complic undermin effort find polit solut syria syrian coalit ad

1926479025,Death toll in Syrian bombing raid on Aleppo rises to 76: monitor.,December 16 2013 Death toll in Syrian bombing raid on Aleppo rises to 76: monitor. Seventy-six people including 28 children were killed on Sunday when Syrian army helicopters dropped barrel bombs on the northern city of Aleppo the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday. Barrel bombs are explosive-filled cylinders or oil barrels often rolled out of the back of helicopters with little attempt at striking a particular target but capable of causing widespread casualties and significant damage. The Britain-based Observatory said that rebel groups in Aleppo issued a statement asking civilians in government-held parts of the city to move away from state security buildings which they said would be targeted in retaliation for the bombings. Slideshow (3 Images) President Bashar al-Assads forces battling rebels in a 2-1/2 year conflict that has killed more than 100000 people frequently deploy air power and artillery against rebel-held districts across the country. They have been unable to recapture eastern and central parts of Aleppo which rebels stormed in the summer of 2012 but they have driven rebel fighters back from towns to the southeast of the city in recent weeks. The conflict has grown sectarian with majority Sunni rebels battling Assads own Alawite sect and Shiite militia. The Observatory - which has a network of opposition pro-government and medical sources - also said on Monday that rebels in northern Aleppo province were threatening to strike two Shiite villages they have surrounded with missiles if barrel bombs were used again by the army.

1926479037,Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria,August 21 2013 Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria. Saudi Arabia called on Wednesday for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss reports of a chemical attack that opposition groups say killed hundreds of people in Syria. It is time for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and overcome differences between its members and restore the confidence of the international community by convening immediately to issue a clear and deterrent resolution that will put an end to this human crisis Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said in a statement. Leading Syrian opposition figure George Sabra said in Turkey the attack in which chemical weapons were used had killed 1300 people. Syria described the reports its army had used chemical weapons as completely untrue. Video footage from districts east of Damascus showed people choking some of them foaming at the mouth and many bodies with no signs of injuries. Prince Saud whose country has been a major supporter of rebels fighting to topple Assad also urged European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels to discuss the Syrian crisis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... warns that continuing to shy away from responsibility in dealing with the Syrian crisis will lead to more of these tragedies he said. A U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and government forces have used chemical weapons in the past. The Swedish scientist leading the team Ake Sellstrom said the latest reports should be looked into but doing so would require a request from a U.N. member state.

1926479038,Assads forces bombard Damascus suburbs after gas attack: activists,August 22 2013 Assads forces bombard Damascus suburbs after gas attack: activists. Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces bombarded rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Thursday activists said keeping up pressure on the besieged region a day after the opposition accused the army of gassing hundreds in a chemical weapons attack. Rockets fired from multiple launchers and heavy mortar rounds hit the neighborhoods of Jobar and Zamalka which are on the eastern outskirts of the capital. Between 500 and 1300 people died on Wednesday from chemical weapons attacks in those areas which are part of what is known as the Ghouta the activists said. Rockets also hit the nearby district of Qaboun to the north where rebel fighters have repelled attempts by loyalist forces to overrun the area and the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp area to the south the activists added. Speaking from Ghouta activist Khaled Amer said explosions from rockets hitting Zamalka were being heard. In Jobar a Damascus neighborhood only 3 km (2 miles) from the historic center of the ancient capital explosions were heard at an army fortification and another compound housing tanks apparently from a rebel attack on the facilities. Fadi al-Shami of the Tarhrir al-Sham Brigade which operates in the eastern Ghouta region said scattered fighting was taking place along the Jobar-Zamalka axis and that opposition forces have moved closer to loyalist lines partly to be in safer positions in case of another chemical attack.

The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations and international organizations to act urgently to save the lives of residents of Deir Ezzor city caught in the middle of fierce fighting between regime forces and ISIS. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Badr Jamous said that the Assad regime continues to brutalize the Syrian people and refuses to implement UN resolutions on Syria in order to cling to power. Activists in Deir Ezzor said that three civilians were killed and many more injured in mortar shelling by ISIS militants on the regime-held parts of the city on Wednesday. Regime forces responded by launching airstrikes on the ISIS-held parts killing three civilians and wounding many more. Cluster bombs an internationally banned weapon were used in the airstrikes. Jamous pointed out that the Assad regime continues to show the utmost disregard for the lives of civilians trapped in Deir Ezzor and seeks to undermine all chances of reaching a political solution. He stressed that the formation of a transitional government body is the only way to gain popular support for the fight against ISIS. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Safwan Jandali called upon the United Nations to shoulder their responsibilities towards the protection of civilians in Syria. He called on international aid organizations to take urgent action to alleviate the suffering of civilians trapped in Deir Ezzor. The task of distributing aid must be left to aid organizations not to regime forces that seized previous shipments of UN aid to the city Jandalai said.

1926479043,26 People Killed in Russian & Assad Regime Airstrikes on Schools & Public Market in Rural Idlib,Wednesday 26 October 2016 26 People Killed in Russian & Assad Regime Airstrikes on Schools & Public Market in Rural Idlib. Airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russia air forces earlier on Wednesday hit a schools complex and a public market in the town of Hass in rural Idlib killing at least 26 civilians and wounding dozens more mostly schoolchildren and teachers. High-explosive parachute-retarded bombs were used in the airstrikes launched in a joint attack by the Assad regime and Russian air forces. The Syrian Coalition condemned this heinous crime against schoolchildren and civilians. In a statement released following the attack the Coalition stressed that the deliberate targeting of civilians using high-explosive weapons is clearly aimed at killing as many people as possible; causing mayhem; forcing civilians to leave their homes; and forcing them to agree to local truces out of the framework of the political process.

1926479056,15 Medics Killed in Russian Airstrikes on Hospital in Southern Aleppo Syrian Coalition Describes the Attack War Crime,Wednesday 21 September 2016 21:51 15 Medics Killed in Russian Airstrikes on Hospital in Southern Aleppo Syrian Coalition Describes the Attack War Crime. Russian jets bombed a medical center in the town of Khan Tuman in southern rural Aleppo earlier on Wednesday killing 15 members of medical staff activists in the town reported. The attack on the hospital comes two days after Russian jets hit a UN-Syrian Red Crescent aid convoy near the town of Urum Alkobra near Aleppo. The attack left 12 people killed including aid workers. The Syrian Coalition said that this barbaric attack on the hospital represents a continuation of the criminal acts perpetrated by Russia aimed to quell the Syrian revolution and force the Syrian people to agree to Russian dictations. The Coalition strongly condemned these crimes calling on the international community and the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to assume its responsibilities towards the protection of civilians in Syria; the establishment mechanisms to enforce the truce; and holding violators of the truce to account. Russia and the Assad regime violated the truce no fewer than 264 times since it came into force last week. Over 65 people have been killed as a result of these violations. These crimes and violations have effectively ended the truce; undermined all chances of a political solution; and demonstrated insistence by the Assad regime and its allies on pursuing the policy of killing and destruction the Coalition added.

1926479066,Bombs in Syrias Aleppo kill 13 pro-Assad fighters: monitor,July 30 2014 Bombs in Syrias Aleppo kill 13 pro-Assad fighters: monitor. Opposition forces in Syria exploded bombs in tunnels under Aleppo late on Tuesday and killed at least 13 fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city a group tracking the violence said. The bombs were placed in two tunnels running under historic parts of the city close to an old police station said the Observatory a Britain-based group which reports on Syria using a network of sources on the ground. The attack appeared to have been carried out by Islamic brigades fighting Assad it said. The blast killed government soldiers and other forces fighting alongside them the Observatory added without giving details. Syrias state news agency made no mention of the attack. Aleppo is one of Syrias main contested cities and government forces took strategic ground around it in June squeezing the main rebel supply line into the city after months of battlefield gains by Damascus. The government advance was backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah an ally of President Bashar al-Assad sources close to the group told Reuters earlier this month. Rebels advanced into Aleppo once Syrias commercial hub in 2012 from the north and took districts in the center of the city. The army has since mainly held the west and south of Aleppo but has been unable to push out opposition fighters. Forces loyal to Assad now control most of Damascus along with the main highway from the capital through to Homs and the western Mediterranean coast. Opposition fighters including a powerful al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State control much of the desert in the north and east.

1926479076,Assads Air Force Kills 65 Civilians in Raqqa,Wednesday 26 November 2014 10:07 Assads Air Force Kills 65 Civilians in Raqqa. The Syrian Coalition condemns the brutal massacre committed by Assads air force in Raqqa today where 65 civilians were killed and dozens wounded in multiple air raids that targeted civilian neighborhoods in the city. Hadi al-Bahra president of the Syrian Coalition warns that the Assad regime will repeat such brutal aerial shelling; pointing out that many seem now convinced that Assad is the major beneficiary of the US-led coalition strikes against ISIS. He calls for the US-led coalition to rethink its strategy in Syria.

The bombing serves the goal the regime and terrorist groups share which is to undermine efforts to set up an administration at all levels and to restore infrastructure and public institutions the Coalition added. The Syrian Coalition held the Assad regime responsible for exposing Syria to various kinds of hegemony foreign occupation terrorism and destruction. It also renewed its calls to build an international coalition to confront the murderous Assad regime and its supporter and work to end it but also to help reach a political solution and continue the fight against terrorism in all its forms including those represented by the Assad regime and its allied foreign militias.

1926479085,ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor,Friday 10 July 2015 19:14 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

France and Britain said on Wednesday that United Nations inspectors currently in Syria should be allowed immediate access to the site of an alleged deadly chemical weapons attack. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing many hundreds of people - by one report as many as 1300 - in a pre-dawn attack on Wednesday. The government of President Bashar al-Assad denied using chemical weapons. I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature British Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters in Paris. Survivors from what activists say is a gas attack rest inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013.

Fabius who earlier spoke over the phone with the head of the opposition Syrian National Coalition called the alleged attack a horrendous tragedy not seen since thousands of Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja in 1988.

1926479102,Interim Minister of Health: Aleppos Hospitals out of Service as Bombardment Continues,Saturday 10 December 2016 14:47 Interim Minister of Health: Aleppos Hospitals out of Service as Bombardment Continues. Minister of health in the Syrian interim government Mohammad Jundi said that the brutal onslaught on Aleppo by the Assad regime Russia and the Iranian militias continues unabated in an unprecedented military escalation that began three weeks ago. Local activists said that at least 56 civilians were killed in Russian and Assad regime airstrikes on besieged eastern Aleppo and its countryside on Friday. The most intense airstrikes targeted the neighborhoods of Jalloum and Maadi as well as the town of Deir Jamal in rural Aleppo. The victims mostly women and children included 25 civilians who were displaced from the neighborhood of Jalloum. Over 1 000 civilians have been killed and thousands more injured in the ongoing ferocious assault on eastern Aleppo since it was launched on November 15. Medical workers in eastern Aleppo are unable to provide treatment for the injured as a result of the acute shortages of essential medical supplies and lack of necessary medical equipment Jundi said. Jundi appealed to the United Nations and human rights organizations to exercise pressure on the Russia and the Assad regime to stop the indiscriminate bombardment on Aleppo pointing out that Russias claims about a halt to the bombing on Aleppo are sheer deception. Jundi warned that the constant bombardment of Aleppo is aimed at forcing the people of Aleppo out of their homes and change the demography of the city in a repeat of what the Assad regime has done in the Damascus suburbs and Homs province.

1926479106,Russian General Staff Warns Against New US Missile Strikes on Syria,April 11 2017 Russian General Staff Warns Against New US Missile Strikes on Syria. Moscow warns against new US missile strikes on Syria chief of the Russian General Staffs Main Operational Directorate Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Militants are delivering toxic chemicals in Khan Shaikhoun the Jira airport East Ghouta and to the West of Aleppo the Russian General Staff said. The aim of these actions is to forge another pretext for accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons and for triggering new US strikes. We warn against such inadmissible steps the general staff said. The general reiterated that the Syrian army does not possess chemical weapons while the remaining two chemical weapons production and storage facilities in Syria are located on the territory controlled by the so-called armed opposition groups.

1926479108,Syrian Coalition: Russia Offering the Syrian People a Choice between Accepting Assads Terms or Total Annihilation,Monday 02 May 2016 20:08 Syrian Coalition: Russia Offering the Syrian People a Choice between Accepting Assads Terms or Total Annihilation. Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Muwaffaq Nyrabia said that Russias policies in Syria are designed to put Syrians in front of two hard choices: either to accept Assads terms in the Geneva negotiations or the bombing and destruction of whole cities and vital civilian facilities will continue. Nyrabia pointed out that the aftermath of the deadly airstrikes by the Assad regime and Russian forces on Aleppo over the past ten days indicates systematic and deliberate attacks against residents of the city. He added that this brutal onslaught on Aleppo is clearly aimed at thwarting the political process. The Syrian Institute of Justice said it had documented 270 civilians killed by Russian and regime bombing in Aleppo during April. The victims included 51 children 28 women five rescue workers and seven medical staff members. The Institute pointed out that the Assad regime and Russian forces pounded the rebel-held parts of the city with 270 barrel bombs 907 air-to-surface missiles 68 surface to-surface missiles 6 bombs containing white phosphorous 36 cluster bombs and one missile suspected to be containing chemical substances. The regime and Russian attacks targeted 517 civilian homes three industrial zones 240 agricultural areas 13 archaeological sites 6 hospitals a school 4 houses of worship 3 popular markets 4 civilian services centers 19 roads 2 civil defense centers and a bakery.

Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

1926479115,Syrian Coalition Declares Idlib Disaster Area amid Deadly Aerial Campaign,Thursday 02 June 2016 16:02 Syrian Coalition Declares Idlib Disaster Area amid Deadly Aerial Campaign. The Syrian Coalition has declared the entire province of Idlib a disaster area in light of continued deadly aerial campaign by the Assad regime and Russian forces. The Coalition has urged the Syrian interim government and all relief and medical organizations in the province to stay on full alert and make all efforts to address the deteriorating situation across Idlib province and meet the needs of civilians there. The Coalition called upon international humanitarian organizations and friendly countries to take urgent action in order to support medical and relief organizations working on the ground. The Coalition also called for expeditiously stepping up support for the Free Syrian Army and enable it defend civilians as well as thousands of internally displaced people against brutal attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces. The Coalition called upon the international community to unequivocally condemn the Russian aggression on Syria and the crimes committed by the Assad regime against the Syrian people. It stressed the need for exercising pressure on the regime and its allies in order to stop the onslaught on Idlib and across all Syrias territories in line with UN Security Council resolutions. The Assad regime and Russian forces have lately intensified aerial bombardment on Idlib province targeting mostly civilian areas hospitals mosques and IDPs camps. The aerial campaign is clearly aimed at destroying rebel-held areas and forcing the civilian population out of their homes. At least 72 civilians including 15 children have been killed and over 325 wounded in the bombing on Idlib over the past few days. The bombings destroyed 4 health facilities a power station a school and a mosque. The Coalition criticized the lack of serious UN action to force an immediate halt to the military operations by the Assad regime and Russian forces and to force the Assad regime to immediately lift the blockades on besieged areas.

1926479120,Assad Regime Escalates Attacks on Besieged Alwaer District in Homs to Force Residents out,Monday 07 November 2016 19:02 Assad Regime Escalates Attacks on Besieged Alwaer District in Homs to Force Residents out. Activists in the district of Alwaer in Homs said that at least 6 civilians were killed and dozens more injured in shelling by regime forces on the neighborhood on Sunday. Regime forces shelled the besieged district with explosive cylinders rockets and heavy artillery targeting mainly residential areas. The Homs Media Center said the Assad regime is escalating attacks on Alwaer after a two-month period hiatus following a truce reached between residents of the district and regime forces. The Syrian Coalition said that the Assad regimes latest escalation in Alwaer is part of a systematic plan to force residents of Alwaer to leave their homes and bring about a demographic change in the area. Activists in Alwaer said that the regimes shelling caused several buildings to collapse adding that regime forces encircling the district prevented the evacuation of the wounded for treatment despite pleas by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. The activists urged residents of the district not to send their children to schools on Monday for fear of their safety and to stay away from the areas exposed to the regimes snipers. The Syrian Coalition earlier stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. It warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. The Coalition has repeatedly called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people.

1926479123,Islamic State killed 270 in Syrian gas field battle: monitor,July 19 2014 Islamic State killed 270 in Syrian gas field battle: monitor. Militant group Islamic State killed 270 soldiers guards and staff when they captured a Syrian gas field on Thursday in the bloodiest clash yet between the al Qaeda offshoot and President Bashar al-Assads forces a monitoring group said on Saturday. The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Thursday that 90 people had been killed and that many were missing after the attack against the Shaar gas field east of Homs in central Syria. But on Saturday the Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through a network of sources in the country on both sides quoted trusted sources as saying that the Islamic State had killed and executed 270 people during the assault. It said at least 40 Islamic State fighters were killed in the offensive. Islamic State has made rapid gains in Syria mostly by seizing territory from rival rebel groups using weaponry brought in from Iraq where last month it managed to take large areas from government forces. It was not immediately possible to verify the Observatorys report. Syrian state media made no mention of the attack. About 30 people had managed to escape to the nearby Hajjar field the Observatory report added. Activists say the Syrian air force has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on positions held by Islamic State formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Islamic State fighters have previously taken control of oilfields in Iraq as well as in Syrias eastern Deir al-Zor province. The group was once the Iraqi affiliate of al Qaeda but al Qaeda disowned it in February after tensions mounted over its expansion into Syria. Islamic State has declared a caliphate in the areas where it operates in Iraq and Syria. There the group has imposed Islamic law carrying out harsh penalties including several executions. In Raqqa in eastern Syria two women were stoned to death for adultery the Observatory said. One was killed on Friday and one on Saturday according to the report which could not immediately be corroborated. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias conflict which started as a peaceful protest movement in 2011 but descended into a multifaceted civil war after a government crackdown.

1926479125,France seeks U.N. resolution on Syria chemical arms.,September 10 2013 France seeks U.N. resolution on Syria chemical arms. France sought to seize the diplomatic initiative on Syria on Tuesday saying it would push for a U.N. resolution setting out terms for the destruction of its chemical weapons and warning of serious consequences if it resisted. The announcement by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius came a day after a surprise proposal by Russia that its Syrian ally hand over its chemical weapons stocks in a move that could avert possible U.S. military strikes. Fabius said the proposed resolution would be under Chapter 7 of the U.N.s charter covering the possible use of military action to restore peace and would require Damascus to reveal without delay the extent of its chemical program and place it under international control for dismantlement. The Russian foreign minister made an offer ... This cannot be used as a maneuver to divert us said Fabius whose country has been a strong backer of action including possible strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assads forces. That is why we have decided to take this initiative. France will put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council in this sense and the procedure starts today. All options remain on the table he added. Western officials have expressed skepticism about the Russian proposal fearing it could simply be a delaying tactic aimed at averting strikes but offering no real prospect of resolving a civil war which sprung from a March 2011 uprising. The draft resolution would include an explicit condemnation of an August 21 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus which the United States says came from Assads forces and killed more than 1400 people. It would also contain a call for those behind the attack to be punished at the International Criminal Court. Fabius said he was looking to schedule visits to China later this week and Russia early next week for talks with the two veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.

1926479133,80 Civilians Killed by Russian Airstrikes on Aleppo despite 48-Hour Truce,Friday 17 June 2016 Civilians Killed by Russian Airstrikes on Aleppo despite 48-Hour Truce. The Syrian Coalition said that Russia has lost its credibility as a sponsor of negotiations. The Coalition said that Russia proves day after day it cannot claim to be a guarantor of the political process in Syria as it is directly complicit in the crimes and terrorism perpetrated against the Syrian people. The Coalition stressed that the latest political developments and the situation on the ground clearly show that every time Russia declares a temporary truce in Syria it is the first to violate it through airstrikes carried out by its forces or those of the Assad regime. On Wednesday Russias Defense Ministry declared a 48-hour truce in Aleppo set to begin on Thursday night with the aim of reducing violence and stabilizing the situation in the city. Russian and Regime forces soon violated the truce. Activists said they recorded no fewer than 30 beaches during the first 24 hours. Over 85 civilians were killed in aerial and artillery bombardments by Russian and regime forces on the city of Aleppo and its surrounding towns and villages on Thursday. Breaches of the 48-hour truce recorded included: 20 by Russian forces 13 by regime forces 2 by the PYD militia and 1 by Iranian-backed foreign militias. The attacks by the Russian regime and PYD forces were concentrated on the Castello road the last supply route into the liberated parts of the city of Aleppo. The road was hit with over 100 missiles. Three civilians two women and a man were killed. Many civilian vehicles were burned as a result of the shelling on the road. Barrel bombs dropped by regimes helicopters also hit Alsabireen mosque in Jisr Alhaj district causing huge fire inside the mosque. Russian jets bombed the towns of Anadan Khan Touman Alzorba Qibtan Aljabal Kafarnaha and Babees in rural Aleppo with the internationally-banned phosphorous.

1926479140,Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre,Wednesday 24 August 2016 16:58 Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre. The Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to re-open the file of the Ghouta Massacre and refer it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine perpetrators of the massacre and bring them to justice so as to make sure such a heinous crime cannot be repeated. Reports by independent human rights groups indicated that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons 136 times since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2118 on September 27 2013 under which Assads declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the Assad regime would not have used banned weapons against Syrian civilians had it not been for its total disregard for the international community as well as its sense of protection and impunity. The Syrian Coalition denounced the extraordinary claims made by the Assad regimes UN representative Bashar Aljaafari who on Monday blamed France for the Ghouta Massacre that claimed the lives of over 1127 civilians a third of them women and children. The Coalition said Aljaafaris claims showed the utmost disregard for the victims of the Ghouta Massacre and are a desperate attempt to deny Assads responsibility for the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Following the massacre the Assad regime surrendered its cache of chemical weapons under the threat of UN sanctions and the use of force by the United States. Over the past three years the Assad regime has persistently denied responsibility for the Ghouta Massacre while seeking to blame opposition groups. However probes by the United Nations and international organizations produced a mass of evidence and facts pointing to the Assad regimes direct responsibility for the chemical attack on eastern Ghouta.

1926479150,Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province,Tuesday 14 November 2017 Syrian Coalition Condemns Horrific Massacre by Russian Air Force in Town of Atareb Aleppo Province. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemns the brutal crime which was committed by aircraft of the Russian occupation forces in the town of Atareb in western rural Aleppo on Monday November 13. Initial reports indicated that over 40 civilians were killed and hundreds more were injured when Russian jets fired vacuum missiles on a popular market in the town. Russia which has used every possible means to undermine the will of the Syrian people and impose devious schemes and projects on them continues to wriggle out of its commitments and obligations towards the de-escalation zones agreement. Instead of honoring its role as a so-called guarantor of the agreement Russia bombed a popular market that was full of civilians in the town of Atareb in broad daylight destroying dozens of houses and buildings though no rebel groups were stationed in the town which is under the authority of a civilian council and a local police force. Instead of changing its positions and exerting pressure on the Assad regime to force it to seriously participate in the Geneva process and abide by UN Security Council resolutions and engage in direct and serious negotiations this crime one again demonstrated that Russia is unwilling to change its stance. The crime has also proved that Russia is determined to side with the Assad regime; continue with the war crimes Against the Syrian people; and that it is not interested in stopping its crime nor forcing its allies to stop the crimes they are committing against the Syrian people. The Syrian Coalition holds Russia directly and fully responsible for the war crimes it has committed in Syria since the beginning of its direct military intervention in Syria as well as for the crimes of genocide and the Assad regimes use of chemical weapons and other internationally prohibited weapons. The Coalition calls on the UN Security Council to condemn this massacre and its perpetrators as well as to prosecute them by all possible means as war criminals and to take serious action to protect Syrian civilians from these continued massacres.

1926479154,Assad Regime Commits Horrific Massacres After Loss of Idlib,Saturday 11 April 2015 18:05 Assad Regime Commits Horrific Massacres After Loss of Idlib. Determined to prevent any aspect of life in areas controlled by rebels the Assad regime continues to wreak havoc and destruction in residential neighborhoods causing mass displacement of civilians and massive damage to the infrastructure. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said in a report that the liberation of the city of Idlib on Saturday March 28 2015 was followed by escalated bombardment from government forces targeting the city and its vital centers such as markets and mosques and some Idlib rural cities most notably Sraqb Sarmin and Maara Al-Numan. Most bombing was carried out by air forces raining barrel bombs and missiles some containing toxic gasses on the city and its surroundings. In less than two weeks the Idlib province has been shelled with about 47 barrel bombs and a minimum of 100 missiles. Before government forces left Idlib they executed 15 detainees by shooting the report added. According to SNHR victims documentation team; the number of victims from Friday March 27 2015 to Friday April 10 2015 has reached 236 individuals as follows: 82 armed opposition gunmen 154 civilians including 54 children and 39 women. Vice president of the Syrian Coalition Nagham al-Ghadiri said that we have repeatedly called on friendly countries to supply rebels with advanced weapons capable of warding off Assads air force and also called on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities towards civilians in Syria. Assads strategy aims to kill any chance for Syrians in the liberate areas to establish civil governance or restore public services. The fierce bombing on Idlib is causing a massive exodus of civilians estimated at over 70% of the population. she added. Local councils civil bodies and rebel factions are making a great effort to run and secure public institutions and facilities to provide services for civilians warning that ISIS might step in and exploit the vacuum and chaos caused by the Assad regime vengeful attacks on the city.

1926479155,Deir Ezzor Civilians Stuck between the Regimes Hammer and ISISs Anvil,Thursday 25 August 2016 Deir Ezzor Civilians Stuck between the Regimes Hammer and ISISs Anvil. Activists in Deir Ezzor said that nearly 58 people including women and children were killed in mutual shelling between regime forces and ISIS militants on the city and its countryside on Wednesday. The plight of civilians in Deir Ezzor is further aggravated as a result of the lack of basic needs including food and medicine. In Deir Ezzor civilians are trapped in a cycle of violence where Russian and regime air forces raid ISIS-held neighborhoods in the city and the extremist group shells the regime-held parts with rockets and mortar rounds. Recent airstrikes by the Assad regime jets targeted civilians queuing at a bakery in the neighborhood of Alommal causing dozens of casualties. The ISIS terrorist group has laid a siege on the regime-held parts of Deir Ezzor since early 2014. ISIS militants prevent civilians from entering regime-held parts while regime forces prevent civilians from leaving parts of the city under their control. Member of the Syrian Coalition Hussein Albuseis condemned the crimes committed by the Assad regime and its allies as well as by ISIS against civilians in Deir Ezzor. He called upon the international community to step up support for the local FSA and rebel groups to enable them oust ISIS and the Assad regime from all Deir Ezzor province. Albuseis pointed out that nearly 200 000 civilians trapped in Deir Ezzor have been suffering a double siege by the Assad regime and ISIS warning of a humanitarian disaster should the citys civilian population be left prey to the barbarity of the Assad regime and ISIS. He expressed hope that these appeals will not fall on deaf ears and prompt an immediate response from the internationally community. Dozens of civilians have starved to death since ISIS tightened the siege on Deir Ezzor in early 2014.

1926479157,Kerry discusses chemical attack with Syrian foreign minister,Sunday 25 August 2013 Kerry discusses chemical attack with Syrian foreign minister. The Syrian government should have granted United Nations inspectors access to the site of an alleged gas attack John Kerry reportedly told Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem in a call on Saturday. Kerry called to make clear that if as they claimed the Syrian regime has nothing to hide it should have allowed immediate and unimpeded access to the site rather than continuing to attack the affected area to block access and destroy evidence a State Department was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Syrian opposition groups have accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching massive chemical attacks near Damascus on August 21 and killing as many as 1300 people. Infographic: Chemical weapons claims (Design by Farwa Rizwan / Al Arabiya English) The Syrian government has strongly denied those allegations but has yet to accede to demands that U.N. inspectors already in the country be allowed to visit the sites of the alleged attacks AFP news agency reports. The secretary further emphasized ... that he had received full assurances from Free Syrian Army commanders that they would ensure the safety of U.N. investigators into the targeted areas the official said. In all these calls the secretary emphasized the importance of quickly determining the facts and underscored the seriousness and gravity of any chemical weapons use the official said. U.S. President Barack Obama received a detailed review of a range of potential options from his top advisers on Saturday on how Washington and its allies could respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack on Damascus by the Syrian government Reuters reported the White House as saying. Obama also spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Syria and agreed to consult about potential responses by the international community the White House said.

1926479159,Dozens Killed in Intensified Russian & Regime Airstrikes on Idlib,Friday 22 July 2016 Dozens Killed in Intensified Russian & Regime Airstrikes on Idlib. Activists said that at least 10 civilians were killed and 50 wounded in airstrikes by Russian forces on Idlib city on Friday morning. The civil administration of Idlib on Thursday announced the full mobilization of the emergency medical services to cope with the high number of casualties among residents of the city and its countryside following a brutal wave of airstrikes by Russian jets that left at least 38 civilians killed and dozens more wounded. The most violent airstrikes targeted civilian neighborhoods of Idlib city as well as the towns of Tal Minnis Sarmada and Maaret Alnouman. Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Muwaffaq Nyrabiya said that military escalation against civilians by the Assad regime and Russian forces comes as the date set by the United Nations for the start the transitional process in Syria nears. Nyrabiya said that such an escalation reinforced doubts repeatedly raised by the Syrian Coalition about the willingness of Russia and the Assad regime to engage seriously in the political process. Nyrabiya pointed out that Russias actions in Syria demonstrate it is insistent on pursuing a military solution in Assads favor. Russias actions however will not weaken the resolve of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition to reclaim freedom and dignity and build a civil state based on inclusivity and the rule of law he stressed. Nyrabiya called on all rebel and FSA groups to reconsider their strategies and lend an ear to calls for them to pull out of Idlib and assign the task of managing the affairs in the city to the local council and the free police forces. The intensified Russian airstrikes on Idlib prompted an exodus of civilians towards the surrounding cities towns and farmlands. Secondary education exams were also postponed as a result of the airstrikes and Friday prayers cancelled in all of the citys mosques.

1926479161,Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib,Monday 15 February 2016 Russian Airstrikes Hit MSF Hospital in Idlib. A hospital supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the town of Maaret al-Nouman in rural Idlib was hit earlier today by Russian air airstrikes. At least seven people were killed and many more wounded in the deliberate attack on the hospital. The hospital was completely destroyed and the fate of at least eight members of staff is still unknown. The Syrian Coalition condemned the attack saying it is not the first hospital to be targeted by Russian warplanes. Russia has targeted civilian neighborhoods medical centers schools and houses of worship. This crime will not be the last as long as the international community keeps silent and shirks its responsibility to respond to them. While we hold Moscow fully responsible for these crimes we warn that the international communitys continued inaction serves as an incentive for Russia to commit more crimes in Syria. Russias acts in Syria will not only negatively affect the political process but will also encourage the spread of terrorism the Syrian Coalition stressed. The Syrian Coalition called upon the ceasefire task force formed as part of the Munich agreement not to ignore the horrible crimes Russia continues to commit against the Syrian people. These crimes would undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement to the conflict. The continued silence over Russias behavior in Syria undoubtedly represents complicity in these crimes and would ruin what has been achieved in Munich the Coalition said. These ongoing crimes especially after the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2254 and the signing off on the Munich agreement undermine all chances of restoring trust in the international community. They cast doubt about the international communitys ability to find a real political solution to end the tragedy unfolding in Syria the Coalition added.

Activists in Aleppo said that the Iranian militias summarily executed six young men in the neighborhood of Sakhour on Friday after those men returned to their homes in eastern Aleppo which completely fell to regime forces. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Yasser Farhan said that the Free Syrian Army and forces of the Syrian revolution will continue to resist the Russian and Iranian invaders until they are ousted from of all Syrian territory. Activists in rural Aleppo said that the Assad regime and Russian air forces having finished the brutal bombing campaign on eastern Aleppo carried out intense airstrikes on western Aleppo over the past two days. Six civilians from one family were killed in airstrikes on the town of Atareb west of Aleppo on Saturday. Regime forces have also significantly escalated aerial and artillery bombardment on Wadi Barada valley northwest of Damascus pounding the rebel-held enclave with tens of barrel bombs and airstrikes over the past two days. Farhan stressed that the international community has a responsibility to stop such crimes pointing out that Russia is still not able to control the situation in Syria or sponsor any peace process. Farhan raised questions about the UN Security Council resolution passed earlier this week which called for the deployment of UN observers in Aleppo. He said that the latest resolution has not yet been implemented just as earlier UNSC resolutions on Syria which called for stopping attacks on civilians; unhindered delivery of aid to besieged and hard-to-reach areas; and the release of detainees were not implemented. Iran is seeking to consolidate its presence in Syria through the deployment of sectarian foreign militias in key areas across the country Farhan warned.

1926479165,Russian Airstrikes Disrupt Last Remaining Ambulance Service in Rural Aleppo,Print this page Tuesday 19 July 2016 16:45 Russian Airstrikes Disrupt Last Remaining Ambulance Service in Rural Aleppo. The relentless aerial bombardment by Russian forces has rendered dysfunctional the last remaining ambulance service in western rural Aleppo director of the service Taysir Hammoud said. Hammoud pointed out that the center for emergency medical services came under intense airstrikes by Russian forces over the past few days. The bombing caused severe damage to the equipment of the center especially ambulance vehicles. Hammoud added that they are working on restoring the medical services in the area but he did not specify a date when the services will be fully restored. Hammoud added that the ambulance service set up medical centers close to the battlefronts in rural Aleppo to provide urgent treatment to those who need it as a result of the ongoing battles. The ambulance teams lost three crewmembers who were killed trying to rescue victims of battles and airstrikes in the area. The ambulance service center in western rural Aleppo set up in 2014 comprises 15 medics 9 ambulance drivers and 4 administrative staff members. The center provided services for civilians and opposition fighters in local makeshift hospitals and helped move the wounded to border crossings with Turkey. The only hospital in the town of Kafar Hamra in northern rural Aleppo was completely destroyed in Russian airstrikes on Thursday killing three medics. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) the Russian air force targeted at least 243 vital civilian facilities including 5 IDP camps between September 30 2015 and March 15 2016 when Russia announced partial withdrawal of its forces from Syria. The targeted civilian facilities also included 51 medical centers 57 infrastructure facilities 52 educational facilities 50 religious centers 25 residential blocks and 5 IDP camps.

1926479178,Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

1926479206,Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians,Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties. Activists said that the Assad regime has recently resorted to spreading rumors and misinformation to instill fear among residents of the district; a tactic Russia used in Ukraine. The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. The coalition warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes.

1926479207,Syrian Coalition Decries the US-led Alliances Silence over Al Raqqa Massacre,Thursday 27 November 2014 Syrian Coalition Decries the US-led Alliances Silence over Al Raqqa Massacre. Nasr al-Hariri Secretary General of the Syrian Coalition decries the silence of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition over Al Raqqa massacre in which dozens of civilians were killed by Assads air force. The world chose to remain silent over one of Assads most horrible massacres committed not only against the people of Al Raqqa but against all humanity. Over 130 civilians were killed and hundreds wounded when Assads air force carried out nine air raids on the city. The US-led coalitions lack of clear and coherent strategy on Syria would risks throwing many disappointed Syrians in the arms of extremist groups not out of conviction of their fanatic principles but out of the growing frustration over the failure of the international community to offer them a better alternative. Hariri also said that it is strange how the US-led coalitions warplanes rushed to punish the criminals who killed the US journalist James Foley but insists on ignoring Assads warplanes have killed thousands of children and women. The basic principle in the charters of Human Rights is that punishment is based on the type and characterization of the crime not on the nature of the offender. The Syrians will not accept this duality that has so far characterized the strategy of the US-led coalition which is avenging the killing of Western citizens but turn a blind eye to the killing of hundreds of thousands Syrians at the hands of the Assad regime. Moreover fighting terrorism in Syrian and the region piecemeal will not eliminate the threat of terrorism which swept the region with the direct support of Assad and his Iranian allies. Hariri pointed out that the bombing that targeted Al Raqqa yesterday is not random at all but a systematic and collective punishment inflicted on civilians.

1926479215,Security Council seeks clarity on chemical weapons reports in Syria,Wednesday 21 August 2013 Security Council seeks clarity on chemical weapons reports in Syria. The U.N. Security Council said on Wednesday that it is seeking clarity on reports suggesting that Syrian regime forces killed 1300 people using chemical weapons. There must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed carefully Argentinas envoy Maria Cristina Perceval said after the council met behind closed doors adding that members welcomed the determination of the secretary general to ensure a thorough impartial investigation. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moons office had said he was shocked by the reports and that U.N. weapons experts in Syria to probe previous allegations were in discussions with Damascus according to AFP. Security Council members France Britain the United States Luxembourg and South Korea had called for the meeting which was held behind closed doors. Diplomats said the joint letter cited credible reports of the use of chemical weapons. We urge you to do all you can to ensure that the mission has urgent access to all relevant sites and sources of information the letter said. The United States called for immediate access to the site of the alleged chemical attack. We are working urgently to gather additional information said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a statement expressing deep concern over the reports. International action was expected to be limited with permanent U.N. member Russia standing firmly by the Assads regime. Russia hastened to back up denials from the Assads administration by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit him according to Reuters. Neighboring Israels Channel 10 television quoted Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon as telling reporters that Syria had used chemical weapons and not for the first time. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that already in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention that rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. If confirmed a major gas attack could increase pressure on Obama to do more to support rebels whose links to militant Islam have helped dampen Western enthusiasm for their cause.

1926479219,Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes,September 9 2013 Factbox: Congress debates Obamas plan for Syria strikes. President Barack Obamas request for congressional authorization for military strikes against Syria is set to dominate the Congress this week and next with the outcome in doubt. Obama is seeking backing for the strikes in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21. Washington blames the Syrian government for the attack which it says kills more than 1400 people. Here are the important steps in Congress: - On Monday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began moving to limit debate on the motion to proceed to a resolution authorizing the use of military force. The motion to proceed is the mechanism for bringing legislation before the full Senate. It is not yet clear whether opponents will allow a simple majority vote on this procedural step or insist on a more difficult 60-vote majority in the 100-member chamber in which Obamas Democrats control 54 seats. This first test vote is now set for Wednesday. - On Monday evening many members of Congress will receive a classified briefing from administration and military officials. For scores of lawmakers this will be their first inside look at the Syria situation. - Reid in consultation with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell will likely decide how many and which amendments to the bill will be debated on the Senate floor. - Obama is due to lunch on Tuesday with Senate Democrats in an attempt to sway enough of them to support a military strike. - He then plans a speech to the nation on Tuesday night which could be a defining moment. Many undecided members of the Senate and House are likely to make up their minds on how they will vote after that speech and into Wednesday. - If the Senate votes to debate the resolution itself opponents could erect another procedural hurdle that would require 60 votes to limit this debate. Should those votes prove necessary and if Reid succeeds in rounding them up a vote on passing the Syria resolution could come on Thursday or Friday. A simple majority vote in favor of the bill would send it to the House for consideration. - The House could simply vote for or against the Senate-passed bill. Or it could amend the bill pass it and send it back to the Senate for approval. Another option though one that seems less likely now is for a House committee to write its own bill for debate in the 435-member House. In any event it could be next week before the full House takes action.

1926479220,Syrias Assad regime likely responsible for chemical attack: rights group,September 10 2013 Syrias Assad regime likely responsible for chemical attack: rights group Reuters Staff. Evidence strongly suggests Syrian government forces were responsible for a poison gas attack that killed more than 1400 people Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday contradicting repeated denials by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S.-based rights group in a report issued in New York said it had reached its conclusion after analyzing witness accounts information of the likely source of the attacks remnants of the weapons used and medical records of victims. The evidence concerning the type of rockets and launchers used in these attacks strongly suggests that these are weapon systems known and documented to be only in the possession of and used by Syrian government armed forces Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch and arms experts monitoring the use of weaponry in Syria have not documented Syrian opposition forces to be in possession of the 140mm and 330mm rockets used in the attack or their associated launchers. The chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1400 people. Syria has been torn by a bitter civil conflict between Assads troops and rebel forces who want to end the Assad familys four-decade rule. The Human Rights Watch report comes as the United States pushes for congressional approval for military strikes on Syria and as U.S. President Barack Obama explores a Russian proposal to put Syrias chemical weapons under international control. Obama has argued that Assad must be punished for the use of poison gas on rebel areas but his plan faces significant resistance from U.S. lawmakers who are worried that a strike could draw the U.S. into the conflict and spark wider conflicts in the Middle East. Assad in an interview on the U.S. CBS television network denied there was any evidence to link his government to the gas attack and warned the United States to expect reprisals for any military strike on his country. Human Rights Watch said it also investigated suggestions the chemical attacks came from opposition forces. Human Rights Watch has investigated alternative claims that opposition forces themselves were responsible for the August 21 attacks and has found such claims lacking in credibility and inconsistent with the evidence found at the scene.

1926479223,Obama says is shifting to domestic priorities from Syria focus,September 12 2013 Obama says is shifting to domestic priorities from Syria focus. Mark Felsenthal. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he is shifting his focus to domestic priorities from a tense period during which he sought congressional approval to use military force against Syria for its suspected use of chemical weapons. Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue and making sure that international attention is focused on the horrible tragedy that occurred there it is still important to recognize that weve got a lot more stuff to do here in this government the president said before a meeting with his Cabinet at the White House. The president said he hopes meetings between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will result in action to eliminate Syrias ability to use chemical weapons again. Obama has asked Congress to authorize military strikes against Syria in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack by the government that killed more than 1400 people on August 21. The issue is on hold pending diplomatic efforts to disarm Syria of chemical weapons. I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry had with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result Obama said. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during a cabinet meeting in the West Wing of the White House in Washington September 12 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were to hold talks on Syria in Geneva. The president cited the budget immigration and implementation of his signature healthcare legislation as concerns he is turning to. The administration faces daunting obstacles on all three fronts and a ticking clock on the budget in particular. Congressional Republicans have sought to eliminate funding for the health law known as Obamacare and want the president to agree to spending cuts in exchange for raising the nations debt limit. Lawmakers must pass legislation to continue funding for government operations by the end of the month or force a government shutdown. Failure to raise the nations debt limit after a date expected in mid-October would trigger a debt default. The administration is also scrambling to make sure Americans lacking health coverage sign up for insurance under the new law starting October 1. Were going to focus on some specific issues including managing some of the budget debates that are going to take place over the next several weeks Obama said. Were going to be talking about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

1926479236,U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites,Thursday 1 August 2013 U.N. inspectors to visit Syria chemical attacks sites. U.N. inspectors will go to Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks have been reported the United Nations said Wednesday. The Syrian government has blocked the inspectors since calling for a U.N. inquiry into the use of the banned arms in March. The mission will travel to Syria as soon as possible to contemporaneously investigate three of the reported incidents said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. The announcement followed an accord reached with the Syrian government when two U.N. envoys went to Damascus last week. According to diplomats the inspectors are being assembled in Europe now and could go to Syria as soon as next week. The U.N. says that Syria Britain France and the United States have informed it of 13 alleged chemical weapons attacks during the 28-month-old conflict. While the initial inquiry will focus on three sites Nesirky said U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon remains mindful of other reported incidents and the mission will also continue to seek clarification from the member states concerned. The spokesman said the first sites to be visited will include Khan al-Assal near the Syrian city of Aleppo where the government reported a chemical weapons attack on March 19. It said at least 26 people including 16 government soldiers were killed. The government and its ally Russia have blamed Syrian rebels for the attack. The Syrian opposition says President Bashar al-Assads forces staged the attack. The other two sites to be visited by the inspectors are Ataybah near Damascus where a suspected attack was staged in March and Homs where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used on December 23 diplomats said. Britain and France have submitted evidence to the United Nations on the Ataybah and Homs attacks which they say was carried out by the government. The Syrian government called for the U.N. inquiry in March. But it then blocked the U.N. inspectors insisting that they be limited to Khan al-Assal. Ban had demanded wider access for the investigation. Ake Sellstrom the Swedish expert in charge of the U.N. inquiry and U.N.

1926479237,Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa,December 19 2016 Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa. Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

1926479240,Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor,July 18 2014 Syrian army Islamic State clash near army airport: monitor. Syrian soldiers clashed with Islamic State militants outside a government-controlled army airport on Friday a British-based monitoring group said part of a major escalation of fighting between the al Qaeda offshoot and the military. The hardline Sunni militants have gained ground in Syria over the past five weeks bolstered by equipment seized in a lightning offensive last month in neighbouring Iraq. On Thursday the group seized the Shaar oilfield east of the central city of Homs in what the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said was one of its bloodiest clashes with President Bashar al-Assads forces. On Friday the death toll from the raid rose to 115 the Observatory said. The fate of 250 others was unknown it said. A video posted online on Thursday purportedly of the battle site showed armed men pacing through a barren desert space speaking in Arabic and German as they reviewed what appeared to be more than 50 bodies many with gunshot wounds to the head chest and legs. Some of the bodies appeared to be young men. Here lie two pigs said one of the men speaking German. At least two multiple-rocket launchers and other military vehicles were visible. The Observatory an anti-Assad group which tracks the violence through a network of contacts in Syria said the government had sent reinforcements backed by helicopters to the nearby Hajjar oil field. In Raqqa province which borders Turkey a woman - sentenced to death for adultery by the Islamic State - was stoned to death the Observatory said. The report could not immediately be corroborated. MILITARY AIRPORT On Friday fighting also broke out between Islamic State militants and government forces at the army airport in Deir al-Zor one of the last major strategic locations in Deir al-Zor province not under the control of the Islamic State. The Syrian army responded to the militants offensive by bombing areas around the airport which supplies its forces in the east of the country the Observatory said. There were no details of casualties. The fighting was just a few hundred metres (yards) from the airport the Observatorys director Rami Abdurrahman said noting that it would be tough for the Islamic State to overcome government forces there. The Islamic State expelled rival rebels from Deir al-Zor city on Monday tightening its hold on the eastern province bordering Iraq. [ID:nL6N0PP2YH] Capturing most of Deir al-Zor province has helped the Islamic State link up territorial gains across Syria and Iraq where it seized the northern city of Mosul in June. Last month it also declared an Islamic caliphate in territory it controls in both countries. The group previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant follows al Qaedas hardline ideology but draws strength from foreign fighters many with experience in Iraq.

1926479251,135 Civilians Killed in Escalating Bombardment on Idlib in Last Three Days,Wednesday 07 December 2016 135 Civilians Killed in Escalating Bombardment on Idlib in Last Three Days. Activists in Idlib province said that at least 135 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces on the province over the past three days. The bombardment targeted mainly public markets and residential buildings in a grave escalation in parallel with the ongoing brutal onslaught on Aleppo and its countryside. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Adnan Rahmoun condemned the escalating war crimes being committed by the Russian and Assad regime forces in Idlib and Aleppo. He lamented the lack of any response by the international community which is standing idly by as the Assad regime and Russia are committing these crimes using internationally banned weapons including vacuum bombs cluster bombs and white phosphorous. Rahmoun called upon the UN Security Council and the international community to put an end to the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime and its allies and to assume their responsibilities to protect civilians. He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment. Activists in rural Idlib said that three regime airstrikes hit a public market in the town of Sarmin on Tuesday killing 10 people including four children and two women. Russian jets launched multiple airstrikes on the main high street in the town of Maaret Alnouman killing eight people and wounding dozens more. Two more civilians were killed in regime airstrikes on the town of Maarrat Masrin. In total over 40 civilians were killed in the aerial bombardment that hit at least 11 towns and villages across Idlib on Tuesday. On Monday Russia and China vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for the imposition of a 7-day cease-fire in Aleppo so that humanitarian aid could reach the citys besieged eastern neighborhoods. The draft resolution was proposed by New Zealand Spain and Egypt.

1926479259,Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor,10 October 2017 Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said.

1926479260,World powers on right track on Syria chemical arms: Putin,October 2 2013 World powers on right track on Syria chemical arms: Putin. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday global powers were on the right track with a plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons and could avert military intervention in the conflict if they worked together. Agreement on the plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons was reached after U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve air strikes to punish Syrias government over an August 21 gas attack the United States says killed more than 1400 people. There is every reason to believe we are on the right track Putin told an investment conference. He said the chemical weapons plan which has rekindled an effort to convene an international conference to seek a solution to the conflict could not have been put in place without support from Obama and the leaders of many countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the VTB Capital Investment Forum Russia Calling in Moscow October 2 2013. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov I believe that if we continue to act in such a coordinated way it will not be necessary to use force and increase the number of people wounded and killed in the long-suffering land of Syria said Putin. Russia has been Syrian President Bashar al-Assads strongest backer during the civil war blocking a number of Western initiatives in the U.N. Security Council and blaming the August 21 gas attack on rebel forces. Russia has emphasized that rebels fighting Assad must also abide by the chemical weapons agreement and made clear it would demand proof of government responsibility for any future attack before approving punishment in the Security Council.

1926479261,Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo.,Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

1926479264,Islamic State executed 700 people from Syrian tribe: monitoring group,August 17 2014 Islamic State executed 700 people from Syrian tribe: monitoring group. Oliver Holmes Suleiman Al-Khalidi. The Islamic State militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group and activists said on Saturday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zor province. The conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdelrahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Reuters cannot independently verify reports from Syria due to security conditions and reporting restrictions. Proclaiming a caliphate straddling parts of Iraq and Syria Islamic State has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes prompting the first U.S. air strikes in Iraq since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zor who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when Islamic State stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zor said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Those who were executed during the storming of the al-Sheitaat area are around 300. The rest were killed in the course of the battles he told Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect his identity. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias civil war which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad a member of the Shiite-derived Alawite minority backed by Shiite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions in Syria with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. Tribal powers in Syria and Iraq have had to make the choice between fighting Islamic State or pledging allegiance. On Friday a video posted on YouTube showed men who said they were from the al-Sheitaat towns of Kishkeih and Abu Hammam pledging full support for Islamic State. We say that what Islamic State stands for is justice a tribal member sitting in a room with dozens of other men said in a statement that was read out. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju called in a video message for other tribes to join them in the fight against the militants. We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will be targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target he said in the video posted on YouTube. Islamic State was condemned on Friday in a U.N. Security Council resolution for gross systematic and widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law.

1926479274,U.S. leaves door open to new U.N. vote on Syria Arshad Mohammed,September 8 2013 U.S. leaves door open to new U.N. vote on Syria Arshad Mohammed. The United States left the door open on Sunday to seeking a United Nations Security Council resolution that could endorse punishing Syria for a chemical weapons attack last month and indicated Arab countries were seeking a tough response. Speaking to reporters after meeting Arab foreign ministers U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said many were leaning toward supporting a G20 statement - already signed by 12 nations including Saudi Arabia - that called for a strong international response following an August 21 chemical attack in Syria. Washington and Paris say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were behind the attack in which more than 1400 are estimated to have been killed and they are considering air strikes to try to deter him from using such weapons again. Kerry told a news conference that Saudi Arabia which has been one of Assads most vocal opponents and diplomats say is one of the main suppliers of arms to the the Syrian rebels supported the strike and they support taking action. French President Francois Hollande increasingly under pressure at home and among European partners to seek a U.N. mandate before any military intervention in Syria suggested on Saturday he could seek a resolution at the Security Council despite previous Russian and Chinese vetoes. French officials say a draft resolution presented jointly by Britain and France at the end of August was not even read by Russia and China let alone discussed. U.N. inspectors are likely to hand in their report later this week as the U.S. Congress debates whether to allow limited strikes on Syria. NO DECISION BY OBAMA On President Hollandes comments with respect to the U.N. the president (Obama) and all of us are listening carefully to all of our friends Kerry said. No decision has been made by the president. After the news conference a U.S. official said Washington was not seeking a Security Council vote at the moment. We have always supported working through the U.N. but have been clear there is not a path forward there and we are not currently considering proposing another vote said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kerrys meeting with Arab ministers including from Bahrain Egypt Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed talks in Lithuania with European foreign ministers who blamed the attack in Syria on Assad but urged waiting for the U.N. inspectors to report before any action. All of us agreed - not one dissenter - that Assads deplorable use of chemical weapons ... crosses an international global red line Kerry said alongside his Qatari counterpart Khaled al-Attiya. A number of countries immediately signed on to the G20 agreement that was reached by now 12 countries on the side of the G20 meeting and they will make their own announcements in the next 24 hours about that. Qatar has strongly backed the Syrian opposition. As for Syria and what Qatar is willing to provide Qatar is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people Attiya said without elaborating.

1926479276,Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo,July 2 2015 Syrian Islamist insurgents launch battle to seize government-held Aleppo. Syrian insurgents led by Islamist groups began a major offensive to gain full control of the divided northern city of Aleppo a monitor and rebels said on Thursday. The fall of Syrias main commercial hub would be a major blow for President Bashar al-Assad restricting his control mainly to a belt of territory stretching north from Damascus to the Mediterranean coast. This would deepen Syrias de facto partition between the Assad-run west and areas held by a patchwork of armed groups. A statement by the groups said their goal was to liberate the city of Aleppo and to ensure that when it fell into their hands it would be ruled by strict sharia principles. The British-based Observatory for Human Rights said a coalition of groups that included al Qaedas Syrian offshoot Nusra Front and Salafi Ahrar al Sham had fired hundreds of mortar bombs on locations in western districts of the city that are held by the Syrian army and allied militias. Much of the fighting was focused on the Jamiyat al-Zahra frontline where the insurgents struck the heavily defended part of the district held by the army according to Rami Abdul Rahman the head of the rights group which tracks the war. The Jamiyat al Zahra which houses several major security compounds has long been coveted by the rebels to allow them to advance into government-held areas and cut army supply lines. The latest flareup of fighting was the widest rebel offensive taking place simultaneously across most front lines since the insurgents took over most of the eastern part of the city in the summer of 2012 Abdul Rahman added. Eight civilians were killed with at least 70 injured with dozens of dead and injured from army personnel and allied militias the head of the monitor said. The Syrian army last month repelled a push by an alliance of rebels including recipients of Western aid fighting under the name of the Free Syrian Army into Aleppos Rashidin district. It was the first rebel advance into the heart of Aleppos government-controlled residential area in more than two years. Insurgents have also been bombarding government-held areas turning the tables after strikes by Syrian forces on insurgent-held parts of what was Syrias most populous city before it become a main battleground in the four-year civil war. Separately the sound of intense fighting including explosions could be heard from the Turkish border town of Kilis about 30 miles (48 km) north of the Syrian city of Azaz witnesses said. The Turkish army stepped up security on their side of the border including armored regiments and special forces following days of deploying troops and equipment to the area security sources said. The sources said the fighting in Azaz was between hardline Islamic State militants and a joint force of al-Nusra and Western-backed rebels who have clashing in northern Aleppo countryside in recent weeks.

1926479281,Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies,October 5 2017 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies. Stephanie Nebehay. Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals schools and people fleeing violence have been targeted by direct air strikes that may amount to war crimes the United Nations said without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants. September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa where 8000 people remain trapped and at least 149 people mostly women and children in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syrias northwest in the last 12 days of September he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama Aleppo and Deir al-Zor Moumtzis said again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days. We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals schools civilian infrastructure being targeted Robert Mardini ICRC regional director for the Middle East told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office. And of course this is outrageous unacceptable he said adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the de-escalation areas including Idlib rural Hama and eastern Ghouta. Taken together these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016 it said. Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure Mardini said. We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure. Syrias six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assads government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions some Western-backed and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River opposition activists former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid. The point here is not to point fingers Mardini said declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes. What should be non-negotiable is the respect for the laws of war everywhere in Syria. This is absolutely critical today.

1926479296,ISIS attacks Kurdish-held town on Turkish border,Saturday 27 February 2016 ISIS attacks Kurdish-held town on Turkish border. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. ISIS militants launched an assault on a Kurdish-controlled town on Syrias border with Turkey on Saturday prompting air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. The attack was launched hours after a cessation of hostilities came into effect under a U.S.-Russian plan although the temporary truce does not apply to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front meaning the Syrian government Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to crush this attack and encircle the attackers although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from ISIS last year in an offensive backed by U.S.-led air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the militant capital. The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS struck the militant positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack 14 Turkish F-16s patrolled the Turkish-Syrian border on Friday Turkish military said. Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south Xelil said. He said dozens of Islamic State fighters had been killed.,arabiya,2/27/2016,raqqa,0,saturday 27 februari 2016 isi attack kurdishheld town turkish border coalit war plane carri 10 air strike tri repel assault syrian observatori human right report said least 45 islam state milit 20 kurdish militia fighter kill isi milit launch assault kurdishcontrol town syria border turkey saturday prompt air strike usl coalit tri drive back hardlin sunni fighter attack tel abyad control syrian kurdish ypg militia nearbi town suluk earli hour saturday ypg spokesman redur xelil turkish secur sourc told reuter coalit war plane carri 10 air strike tri repel assault syrian observatori human right report said least 45 islam state milit 20 kurdish militia fighter kill attack launch hour cessat hostil came effect usrussian plan although temporari truce appli isi alqaeda affili nusra front mean syrian govern moscow coalit reserv right strike truce appear larg hold across much syria xelil said ypg syrian kurdish intern secur forc abl crush attack encircl attack although gave casualti toll ypg captur tel abyad isi last year offens back usl air strike town lie north raqqa key suppli line milit capit turkish secur sourc said attack launch two front sound gunfir explos audibl town akcakal turkish side continu sever hour intermitt gunfir could still heard secur sourc wit akcakal said war plane thought usl coalit isi struck milit posit turkish armi increas patrol side border directli address tel abyad attack 14 turkish f16 patrol turkishsyrian border friday turkish militari said xelil said attack infiltr turkish border north reiter accus turkey support group turkey consist deni accus secur sourc said recent measur stop illeg cross meant imposs attack enter turkey attack infiltr south xelil said said dozen islam state fighter kill

1926479298,The Assad Regime & Chemical Weapons,1. Ghouta: On August 21 2013 the Assad regime fired rockets filled with Sarin gas on rebel-held Ghouta rural Damascus killing at least 1400 civilians including women and children. 2. Red lines: Western as well as Arab states condemned the attacks and as it was crossing a red line drawn earlier by US President Barack Obama the United States prepared for a punitive strike moving its warships in the Mediterranean closer to Syria. 3. Strikes: On October 9 2013 US Foreign Secretary John Kerry made a hint at the possibility of averting the strike if the Assad regime were to hand over its chemical arsenal. Early in September 2013 the United States and Russia reached the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons which was endorsed later on by the UN Security Council with resolution 2118. 4. OPCW: On 15 November 2013 the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) decides: for all other declared chemicals: beginning of destruction as soon as possible with completion of destruction not later than 30 June 2014. The OPCW-UN Joint Mission was formally established on 16 October 2013. 5. Missed deadlines: Since then the Assad regime has been widely accused of dragging its feet having missed a series of deadlines including a deadline to ship the most lethal of chemical components out of Syria by the end of 2013 a February 5 2014 deadline to move all chemicals abroad for destruction and a deadline to destroy all of its chemical weapons production sites by 15 March 2014. 6. 15 poison gas attacks: The Assad regime has used poison gas at least 15 times in recent months. The OPCW announced on Tuesday April 29 2014 that it will send a fact-finding mission to investigate the recent use of chlorine gas in Syria. 7. Discrepancies: On June 4 2014 Reuters reported the head of the OPCW-UN Joint Mission Sigrid Kaag revealed during a briefing to the UN Security Council that there were discrepancies in the original declaration of the Assad regimes stockpile. This declaration suggests Assad might be able to keep chemical materials. 8. Chemical warheads: Recently activists reported that the regime keeps rockets with chemical warhead in a mountainous area west of the central city of Hama. 9. Warehouses & bunkers: Falling short of its international obligations the regime has proposed to seal off seven warehouses and five underground bunkers instead of dismantling them. Having discussed outstanding issues with the Assad regime experts from the OPCW-UN Joint Mission are supposed to brief the OPCWs executive council on their findings on June 17 in The Hague. 10. Missing June 30 deadline: In the eighth and latest letter from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council dated 23 May 2014 the UNSG observes: It is now evident that some activities related to the elimination of the chemical weapons program of the Syrian Arab Republic will continue beyond 30 June 2014.

1926479310,World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim,Wednesday 21 August 2013 World leaders react to Syria chemical attack claim. World leaders have responded to the claim by activists in the Syrian Revolution General Commission that at least 640 people were killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region. The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. The chief of a U.N. inspectors team visiting Syria says he wants to look into the claims. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom says the high numbers of killed and wounded being reported sound suspicious. He told Swedish broadcaster SVT that this sounds like something we need to look into. Turkey also called on U.N. inspectors to look into Syrian rebel reports and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Light must immediately be shed on these claims and the United Nations mission that was formed to investigate chemical weapons claims in Syria should look into these claims and reveal its findings the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. If these allegations are found to be true it will be inevitable for the international community to take the necessary stance and give the necessary response to this savagery and crime against humanity it said. The opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba told Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts.,arabiya,8/21/2013,damascus,0,wednesday 21 august 2013 world leader react syria chemic attack claim world leader respond claim activist syrian revolut gener commiss least 640 peopl kill nerv ga attack syria ghouta region arab leagu call wednesday un chemic weapon inspector insid syria immedi visit site incid arab leagu chief nabil alarabi urg inspector statement go immedi eastern ghouta see realiti situat investig circumst crime britain said wednesday would rais report chemic weapon attack forc loyal syrian presid bashar alassad unit nation secur council call damascu give un inspector access site reuter report deepli concern report hundr peopl includ children kill airstrik chemic weapon attack rebelheld area near damascu british foreign secretari william hagu said statement franc also call action un cabinet session holland announc intent ask un visit site attack govern spokeswoman najat vallaudbelkacem told report wednesday inform obvious requir verif confirm ad chief un inspector team visit syria say want look claim swedish chemic weapon expert ake sellstrom say high number kill wound report sound suspici told swedish broadcast svt sound like someth need look turkey also call un inspector look syrian rebel report said monitor situat great concern light must immedi shed claim unit nation mission form investig chemic weapon claim syria look claim reveal find foreign ministri said statement alleg found true inevit intern commun take necessari stanc give necessari respons savageri crime human said opposit syrian nation coalit call urgent un secur council meet subject call secur council conven urgent nation coalit leader ahm aljarba told alarabiya news channel condemn syrian armi bombard ghouta suburb damascu massacr attack rebelheld area eastern damascu regim forc step militari oper eastern ghouta western ghouta zone damascu region aircraft rocket launcher caus sever dozen dead wound syrian observatori human right told afp news agenc intens bomb outskirt capit could heard resid damascu grey cloud cap sky britainbas observatori reli vast network activist ground medic said armi oper aim recaptur madhamiyat elsham area southwest damascu local coordin committe lcc network activist report hundr casualti brutal use toxic ga crimin regim part western ghouta accord reuter report use chemic agent could immedi verifi news coincid visit damascu unit nation team chemic weapon expert

1926479318,Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall,August 24 2014 Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall. Islamic State militants stormed an air base in northeast Syria on Sunday capturing it from government forces after days of fighting that cost more than 500 lives a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said. Residents of Tabqa city tour the streets on motorcycles carrying flags in celebration after Tabqa air base fell to Islamic State militants in nearby Raqqa city August 24 2014. REUTERS/Stringer The Syrian army sent reinforcements to the base overnight on Friday to fight Islamic State which controls roughly a third of northern and eastern Syria. Syrian television had shown footage of army forces defending the base on Saturday who had said it was safe from Islamic States advances. Many of the Islamic State fighters died after Syrian warplanes bombarded the area the Observatory said. MILITARY BASES Slideshow (3 Images) Islamic State a radical offshoot of al Qaeda has taken three Syrian military bases in the area in recent weeks boosted by arms seized in Iraq. Syria is calculating that the IS push to reshape the Middle East will eventually force the West to deal with President Bashar al-Assad as the only way to tackle the threat sources familiar with Syrian government thinking have said. Elsewhere in Syria the group withdrew from northern areas it controlled outside the city of Homs on Sunday and retreated east after coming under attack from rival Islamist fighters the Observatory said. Fighters from the group withdrew from a headquarters north of Homs on the orders of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the Observatory said citing sources in the area. They said IS gave up the territory to Nusra Front al Qaedas official wing in Syria. As well as Nusra Front Western-backed rebels have also been fighting IS in Syria but have regularly been defeated by the group which in June declared an Islamic caliphate in the territory it controls. Activists have accused the Syrian army of avoiding confrontations with IS because it has weakened rival rebel groups also battling Assad.

1926479326,Rescuers say gas dropped on Syrian town where Russian copter downed,Aug. 1 2016 Rescuers say gas dropped on Syrian town where Russian copter downed. A Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said on Tuesday a helicopter dropped containers of toxic gas overnight on a town close to where a Russian military helicopter was shot down hours earlier. The opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) accused President Bashar al Assad of being behind the attack. Assad has denied previous accusations of using chemical weapons. A spokesman for the Syria Civil Defense said 33 people mostly women and children were affected by the gas which they suspect was chlorine in Saraqeb in rebel-held Idlib province. The group which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers posted a video on YouTube apparently showing a number of men struggling to breathe and being given oxygen masks by people in civil defense uniforms. Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gasses. The Syrian Civil Defense was not able to determine the type of the gas said the spokesman. The Syrian government and its Russian allies were not immediately available for comment. The SNC said in a statement: After shelling besieging and killing civilians and perpetrating war crimes on them the Assad regime has resorted once again and in breach of UN resolutions 2118 and 2235 to using chemical substances and toxic gasses. The daily reality confirms that all the international agreements and previous security council decisions be they about chemical weapons or otherwise are meaningless for the Assad regime. The Civil Defense spokesman said it was the second time Saraqeb had been hit by toxic gas. The group was aware of around nine suspected chlorine gas incidents across Idlib province since the conflict began he said. Monitors at the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence on all sides in the civil war said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday wounding a large number of citizens. Russias defense ministry said a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb during the day on Monday killing all five people on board in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life for Russian forces since they started operations in Syria. Denials The helicopter came down roughly mid-way between Aleppo and Russias main air base at Khmeimim in the western province of Latakia near the Mediterranean coast. Russian air power began supporting Syrian President Bashar al Assad late last year an intervention which tipped the balance of the war in Assads favor eroding gains the rebels had made that year. The Russian defense ministry said the Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo as it made its way back to Khmeimim. No group has claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter. Government and opposition forces have both denied using chemical weapons during the five-year-old civil war. Western powers say the government has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government and Russia have accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian government agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulfur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.,arabiya,8/1/2016,idlib,0,aug 1 2016 rescuer say ga drop syrian town russian copter down syrian rescu servic oper rebelheld territori said tuesday helicopt drop contain toxic ga overnight town close russian militari helicopt shot hour earlier opposit syrian nation coalit snc accus presid bashar al assad behind attack assad deni previou accus use chemic weapon spokesman syria civil defens said 33 peopl mostli women children affect ga suspect chlorin saraqeb rebelheld idlib provinc group describ neutral band search rescu volunt post video youtub appar show number men struggl breath given oxygen mask peopl civil defens uniform mediums barrel fell contain toxic gass syrian civil defens abl determin type ga said spokesman syrian govern russian alli immedi avail comment snc said statement shell besieg kill civilian perpetr war crime assad regim resort breach un resolut 2118 2235 use chemic substanc toxic gass daili realiti confirm intern agreement previou secur council decis chemic weapon otherwis meaningless assad regim civil defens spokesman said second time saraqeb hit toxic ga group awar around nine suspect chlorin ga incid across idlib provinc sinc conflict began said monitor britainbas syrian observatori human right track violenc side civil war said barrel bomb fell saraqeb late monday wound larg number citizen russia defens ministri said russian helicopt shot near saraqeb day monday kill five peopl board biggest offici acknowledg loss life russian forc sinc start oper syria denial helicopt came roughli midway aleppo russia main air base khmeimim western provinc latakia near mediterranean coast russian air power began support syrian presid bashar al assad late last year intervent tip balanc war assad favor erod gain rebel made year russian defens ministri said mi8 militari transport helicopt shot deliv humanitarian aid aleppo made way back khmeimim group claim respons down helicopt govern opposit forc deni use chemic weapon fiveyearold civil war western power say govern respons chlorin chemic attack govern russia accus rebel use poison ga un investig establish sarin ga use eastern ghouta 2013 unit state accus damascu attack estim kill 1429 peopl includ least 426 children damascu deni respons blame rebel later year unit nation syrian govern agre destroy state declar stockpil chemic weapon process complet januari 2016 organ prohibit chemic weapon confirm late 2015 sulfur mustard commonli known mustard ga use first time conflict without say parti manysid conflict thought use
1926479327,Blaming Assad Trump says Syria attack cannot be tolerated,Wednesday 5 April 2017 Blaming Assad Trump says Syria attack cannot be tolerated. Decrying an affront to humanity President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that a chemical weapons attack in Syria cannot be tolerated but did not say what the US might do in response. He blamed the attack squarely on Syrian President Bashar Assad. Trump speaking alongside Jordans King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden offered no details about what steps the US might take in response even as his UN ambassador Nikki Haley was promising a strong and perhaps even unilateral response. But Trump said the attack was so horrific and noted that it had killed innocent people small children and even beautiful little babies. These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated Trump said. He said the US stood with its global allies to condemn this horrific attack. The United States and Russia were trading conflicting assertions Wednesday about who launched a chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 72 people as world leaders grasped for a response to the latest atrocity in Syrias intractable civil war. President Donald Trump accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Queen Rania shakes hands with Jordans King Abdullah II in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington Wednesday April 5 2017. (AP) As Trump stood by his charge that Assads forces were responsible Russia disagreed. The staunch Assad ally insisted that the chemicals were dispersed when Syrian warplanes bombed a facility where rebels were building chemical weapons. At the United Nations Trumps envoy threatened unilateral US action if the world body failed to act. When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action Haley declared. She addressed an emergency meeting of the Security Council which was weighing a resolution condemning chemical weapons use in Syria. Russia which has veto power is opposed. Yet in Moscow Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova focused her attention elsewhere: Its necessary to demand that the rebels offer full access to study the area and collect necessary information. Leaders and officials in other countries including Britain and Israel joined the US in saying Assads forces were responsible. A US official said an American review of radar and other assessments showed Syrian aircraft flying in the area at the time of the attack. Russian and coalition aircraft were not there at that time said the official who wasnt authorized to discuss intelligence publicly and requested anonymity. Washington hasnt yet concluded what type of chemical was used. On Tuesday President Donald Trump split the blame between Syrias embattled leader and former President Barack Obama for the countrys worst chemical weapons attack in years. While calling the attack reprehensible and intolerable Trump said Obama did nothing after Assad crossed the former US leaders red line in 2013. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution Trump said. The political tone of Trumps statement took many US officials by surprise. They noted that US presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trumps National Security Council had been preparing a different statement until the presidents closest advisers took over the process. The officials werent authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. The presidents eldest daughter and top adviser Ivanka Trump took a more compassionate tone tweeting Wednesday Heartbroken and outraged by the images coming out of Syria following the atrocious chemical attack yesterday. At least 72 people died in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The World Health Organization said victims seemed to show symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using firehoses to wash the chemicals from victims bodies and lifeless children being piled in heaps.,arabiya,4/5/2017,idlib,1,wednesday 5 april 2017 blame assad trump say syria attack cannot toler decri affront human presid donald trump declar wednesday chemic weapon attack syria cannot toler say us might respons blame attack squar syrian presid bashar assad trump speak alongsid jordan king abdullah ii rose garden offer detail step us might take respons even un ambassador nikki haley promis strong perhap even unilater respons trump said attack horrif note kill innoc peopl small children even beauti littl babi heinou action assad regim cannot toler trump said said us stood global alli condemn horrif attack unit state russia trade conflict assert wednesday launch chemic weapon attack syria kill 72 peopl world leader grasp respons latest atroc syria intract civil war presid donald trump accompani first ladi melania trump queen rania shake hand jordan king abdullah ii oval offic white hous washington wednesday april 5 2017 ap trump stood charg assad forc respons russia disagre staunch assad alli insist chemic dispers syrian warplan bomb facil rebel build chemic weapon unit nation trump envoy threaten unilater us action world bodi fail act unit nation consist fail duti act collect time life state compel take action haley declar address emerg meet secur council weigh resolut condemn chemic weapon use syria russia veto power oppos yet moscow russian foreign ministri spokeswoman maria zakharova focus attent elsewher necessari demand rebel offer full access studi area collect necessari inform leader offici countri includ britain israel join us say assad forc respons us offici said american review radar assess show syrian aircraft fli area time attack russian coalit aircraft time said offici wasnt author discuss intellig publicli request anonym washington hasnt yet conclud type chemic use tuesday presid donald trump split blame syria embattl leader former presid barack obama countri worst chemic weapon attack year call attack reprehens intoler trump said obama noth assad cross former us leader red line 2013 heinou action bashar alassad regim consequ past administr weak irresolut trump said polit tone trump statement took mani us offici surpris note us presid rare attack predecessor aggress event like chemic weapon attack democrat republican abhor sever offici involv intern administr discuss said trump nation secur council prepar differ statement presid closest advis took process offici werent author speak publicli matter demand anonym presid eldest daughter top advis ivanka trump took compassion tone tweet wednesday heartbroken outrag imag come syria follow atroci chemic attack yesterday least 72 peopl die town khan sheikhoun world health organ said victim seem show symptom consist nerv agent exposur video scene show volunt medic use firehos wash chemic victim bodi lifeless children pile heap
1926479330,Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy,Saturday 15 April 2017 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy. A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to enter Aleppo on Saturday killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more after an evacuation deal between Syrias warring sides halted and stranded thousands at two transit points on the city outskirts. Images posted by the outlets showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and flaming vehicles belching out thick black smoke. British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 24 dead and dozens more wounded. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts which had been waiting to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself carrying people evacuated from two Shiite villages on Friday. The residents alongside hundreds of pro-government fighters had left the two rebel-besieged villages in northwest Idlib province under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families moved out of a government-besieged area near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at two transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya the Shiite villages were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to Idlib province which the armed opposition controls. The agreement is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua Mehdi Tahhan said. We had no choice A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around Ahmed 24 said. Were sad and angry about what has happened he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya. Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which include areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.,arabiya,4/15/2017,aleppo,0,saturday 15 april 2017 death toll mount bomb blast aleppo evacue bu convoy bomb blast hit bu convoy wait enter aleppo saturday kill least 100 wound hundr evacu deal syria war side halt strand thousand two transit point citi outskirt imag post outlet show bodi lie next char buse window blown flame vehicl belch thick black smoke britishbas monitor syrian observatori human right count 24 dead dozen wound blast hit buse rashidin area aleppo outskirt wait cross rebelheld territori governmentcontrol citi carri peopl evacu two shiit villag friday resid alongsid hundr progovern fighter left two rebelbesieg villag northwest idlib provinc deal exchang hundr sunni insurg famili move governmentbesieg area near damascu delay agreement left evacu stuck two transit point aleppo outskirt sinc late friday resid alfoua kefraya shiit villag wait rashidin area rebel resid madaya near damascu wait governmentheld ramousah bu garag mile away transport idlib provinc arm opposit control agreement one sever recent month seen presid bashar alassad govern take back control area long besieg forc alli observatori said delay caus fact rebel zabadani anoth town near damascu includ deal yet grant safe passag proopposit activist said insurg blame delay partli fact smaller number progovern fighter left shiit villag agre earlier saturday transit point buse alfoua kefraya wait one resid said yet sure would live aleppo ill see rest group prepar hous land belong alfoua mehdi tahhan said choic madaya resid speak bu garag insid aleppo said peopl wait sinc late friday allow leav there drink water food bu garag small there much space move around ahm 24 said sad angri happen said mani peopl felt forc leav said choic end besieg insid small area madaya syria opposit say evacu deal includ area aleppo district citi hom amount forc displac assad oppon syria main urban center west countri agreement also caus demograph chang say displac mostli sunni muslim syria popul mostli sunni assad alawit religi minor often consid offshoot shiit islam back militarili russia shiit fighter iran lebanes hezbollah group syria sixyearold conflict assad militari advantag rebel west thank russia intervent 2015 although insurg still fight back made gain area
1926479334,Syrian opposition: 1300 killed in chemical attack on Ghouta region,Wednesday 21 August 2013 Syrian opposition: 1300 killed in chemical attack on Ghouta region. At least 1300 people have been killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region leading opposition figure George Sabra said on Wednesday. In response the opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba added to Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. Meanwhile The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. Activists at the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council said regime fighter planes were flying over the area after the bombardment accusing the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical agents. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters news agency the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts. In an interview with Al Arabiya Syrian National Coalition chief Ahmad Jarba called on the U.N. investigators to travel to Ghouta the site of the massacre. Activists from the grassroots Local Coordination Committee reported at least 30 bodies had been brought to one field hospital in Kafr Batna neighborhood a few miles east of central Damascus according to Reuters. Meanwhile the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. Activists at the Local Coordinating Committees said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. Regime denial Meanwhile Syrian authorities denied charges that the army used chemical weapons in the attacks. Reports on the use of chemical weapons in (the suburbs of) Ghouta are totally false state news agency SANA said. It dismissed as unfounded the reports from opposition activists and said satellite news channels carrying the reports are implicated in the shedding of Syrian blood and support terrorism. Its an attempt to prevent the U.N. commission of inquiry from carrying out its mission the statement added.

1926479349,Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off?,Friday 23 August 2013 Syria: have the Chemical Weapons gloves come off? As the international community tries to wrap its head around the recent allegations of chemical weapons attack in Syria numerous unanswered questions remain on the type of agent used and the party who carried it leaving the door open on the repercussions of such an attack on the diplomatic and military levels. News of the Ghoutta Massacre have surfaced on Wednesday with the opposition accusing the Syrian government of launching a Chemical attack and killing between 1000 and 1800 people. Understanding the attack Based on videos of responders that surfaced after the attack and the nature of casualties Gwyn Winfield editor of CBRNe World a publication that specializes in unconventional weapons tells Al-Arabiya that they suggest that it might be chemical biological or radiological device. The symptoms which included shortage of breath pinpoint pupils mucus secretions that it was a chemical attack but exactly which chemical it is is difficult to decide says the expert. Verifying the kind of agent used and getting specifics on the attack would require according to Winfield a sample of the agent itself or a blood or hair sample from a victim or casualty. The least value evidence would be water or soil from the area where the rockets landed. While lot of fingers have been pinpointed in different directions after the attack with the Assad regime denying the attack altogether and the opposition implicating the government three indications are mandatory to know in order to identify the source says Winfield. They are: the agent itself the delivery system (rocket/shell/mortar and the device that fires it) and the skill needed to bring the three together (personnel). The most difficult part in this is identifying the agent as Syria has the delivery system and skill in abundance. Winfield notes that the Assad regime has stated that they have a close hold on the agent a statement that is designed to assure Western powers as much as allies that the regime has control over these weapons. But the risk of the regime losing control over such material has long been a concern of Washington and neighbors of Syria. Winfield says that all the rebels would need is overrun an ammunition dump with a small supply of agent to stage such an attack. Repercussions The concern in Washington and in many Western capitals is that regardless of who staged the attack the turn of events towards chemical weapons use in Syria or these weapons falling in the wrong hands is a red line and a major security threat. Andrew Tabler a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells Al-Arabiya that if the chemical weapons use is confirmed on such a massive scale it will be much harder for the Barack Obama administration not to respond warning that this might be a sign of more systematic use in the future if we are not there already. The Wall Street Journal quoting Pentagon officials said yesterday that the U.S. began refining its military options for possible strikes in Syria. In a parallel effort Secretary of State John Kerry is working the diplomatic track and has placed calls to his French Russian and Turkish counterparts to discuss potential response. Obama told CNN today that core national interests are now at stake if Chemical weapons use is verified both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating as well as needing to protect our allies our bases in the region. Tabler does not expect an immediate military action however due to the time needed to plan militarily and for diplomacy and coalition building a priority for the Obama administration. Still he warns that Washington can not afford waiting too long. But even military action in the form of airstrikes would not resolve the Chemicals weapons threat. Winfield points out that it is very difficult to protect these weapons and the chances of killing everyone that knows how to operate these systems is slim as is the chance of destroying every mortar howitzer and rocket battery. He says that destroying a chemical agent is very difficult to do safely and it would require special forces on the ground something that the U.S. has been very reluctant about doing in Syria.,arabiya,8/23/2013,damascus,0,friday 23 august 2013 syria chemic weapon glove come intern commun tri wrap head around recent alleg chemic weapon attack syria numer unansw question remain type agent use parti carri leav door open repercuss attack diplomat militari level news ghoutta massacr surfac wednesday opposit accus syrian govern launch chemic attack kill 1000 1800 peopl understand attack base video respond surfac attack natur casualti gwyn winfield editor cbrne world public special unconvent weapon tell alarabiya suggest might chemic biolog radiolog devic symptom includ shortag breath pinpoint pupil mucu secret chemic attack exactli chemic difficult decid say expert verifi kind agent use get specif attack would requir accord winfield sampl agent blood hair sampl victim casualti least valu evid would water soil area rocket land lot finger pinpoint differ direct attack assad regim deni attack altogeth opposit implic govern three indic mandatori know order identifi sourc say winfield agent deliveri system rocketshellmortar devic fire skill need bring three togeth personnel difficult part identifi agent syria deliveri system skill abund winfield note assad regim state close hold agent statement design assur western power much alli regim control weapon risk regim lose control materi long concern washington neighbor syria winfield say rebel would need overrun ammunit dump small suppli agent stage attack repercuss concern washington mani western capit regardless stage attack turn event toward chemic weapon use syria weapon fall wrong hand red line major secur threat andrew tabler senior fellow washington institut near east polici tell alarabiya chemic weapon use confirm massiv scale much harder barack obama administr respond warn might sign systemat use futur alreadi wall street journal quot pentagon offici said yesterday us began refin militari option possibl strike syria parallel effort secretari state john kerri work diplomat track place call french russian turkish counterpart discuss potenti respons obama told cnn today core nation interest stake chemic weapon use verifi term us make sure weapon mass destruct prolifer well need protect alli base region tabler expect immedi militari action howev due time need plan militarili diplomaci coalit build prioriti obama administr still warn washington afford wait long even militari action form airstrik would resolv chemic weapon threat winfield point difficult protect weapon chanc kill everyon know oper system slim chanc destroy everi mortar howitz rocket batteri say destroy chemic agent difficult safe would requir special forc ground someth us reluct syria
1926479352,Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus,August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

1926479354,Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east,August 11 2014 Islamic State beheads crucifies in push for Syrias east. Oliver Holmes Suleiman Al-Khalidi. Islamic State has crushed a pocket of resistance to its control in eastern Syria crucifying two people and executing 23 others in the past five days a monitoring group said on Monday. The insurgents who are also making rapid advances in Iraq are tightening their grip in Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. Fighters from the al-Sheitaat tribe in eastern Deir al-Zor had tried to resist Islamic States advance this month according to residents near the area and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring organization. In al-Shaafa a town on the banks of the Euphrates river Islamic State beheaded two men from the al-Sheitaat clan on Sunday the Observatory said and gave residents a 12-hour deadline on Monday to hand over members of the tribe. In other parts of Deir al-Zor province the militants crucified two men for the crime of dealing with apostates in the city of Mayadin and two others were beheaded for blasphemy in the nearby town of al-Bulel the Observatory said. Islamic State which has fought the Syrian army Kurdish militias and Sunni Muslim tribal forces has made rapid gains in Syria since it seized northern Iraqs largest city Mosul on June 10 and declared an Islamic caliphate. The Observatory said a further 19 men from the al-Sheitaat tribe were executed on Thursday 18 shot dead and one beheaded on the outskirts of Deir al-Zor city. It said the men worked at an oil installation. No one will now dare from the other tribes to move against Islamic State after the defeat of the al-Sheitaat said Ahmad Ziyada al-Qaissi an Islamic State sympathizer contacted by Skype from Mayadin. Tribal sources say the conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after Islamic State took over of two oil fields in July. One of those al-Omar is the biggest oil and gas field in Deir al-Zor and has been a lucrative source of funds for rebel groups. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju called in a video message for other tribes to join the fight against Islamic State. We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target he said in the video posted on YouTube on Sunday. WINNING RESPECT Damaged military vehicles that belonged to forces loyal to Syrias President Bashar al-Assad are parked at the armys 17th Division base after it was seized by fighters from the Islamic State outside Syrias northern Raqqa province August 10 2014. REUTERS/Stringer A Syrian human rights activist from Deir al-Zor who fled for Turkey last year said rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad had retreated to al-Sheitaat tribal areas from which they had been trying to mount resistance to Islamic State. He said on condition of anonymity that the resistance had been crushed in the last few days. The situation is very bad but the people cant repel them he said. He said that in tandem with their violent campaign Islamic State was distributing gas electricity fuel and food to garner local support. It is a poor area. They are winning support this way. They won a lot of support this way. They are halting theft and punishing thieves. This is also giving them credibility. Slideshow (2 Images) Another resident of Deir al-Zor Abdullah al-Noami said that four al-Sheitaat towns had fallen. These areas have fallen into the hands of Islamic State after the withdrawal of the (al-Sheitaat) fighters. The youths who were found were executed or their heads were cut off on the grounds that they fought against Islamic State he said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias civil war which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad a member of the Shiite-derived Alawite minority backed by Shiite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. In Raqqa Islamic States power base in Syria its hold appears to be growing only firmer even as Syrian government forces intensify air strikes on territory held by the group. One Syrian living in an area of Islamic State control near Raqqa said the number of its fighters in the streets had grown dramatically in the last few weeks particularly since it captured the armys 17th Division at the end of July. The group has levied a tax on non-Muslims and settled foreign fighters in confiscated homes said the resident who asked for anonymity due to security concerns. But despite that as in Deir al-Zor it has won a degree of respect among locals by curbing crime using their version law of and order. For youths without work salaries offered by Islamic State are one of the few sources of income. The (Islamic) State has respect and standing and its voice is heard said the resident speaking by Skype.

1926479355,Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo,Tuesday 12 July 2016 Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo. Rebel fighters launched a major assault on government-held districts of Syrias long-divided Aleppo on Monday after the regime severed their only remaining supply route into the battleground city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began with anti-government protests in 2011 and which has since killed more than 280000 people. Rebels launched the offensive at dawn to reopen the Castello Road their last lifeline into the northern city an AFP correspondent said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 19 regime forces were killed Monday when rebels blew up a tunnel in the Old City. Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said: The opposition has not advanced because of the heavy aerial bombardment the regime is carrying out on the areas where fighting is underway. Air raids on the rebel-held parts of Aleppo killed 13 civilians Monday the Observatory said most of them in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood near the front line. An AFP journalist saw rescue workers help a stocky shirtless man out of the rubble in Bab al-Maqam his face and thick beard caked in dust. The unidentified man entered a field hospital and embraced the limp bodies of two young boys. He was martyred. Hes gone he said crying over the body of one them. Several rounds of UN-brokered talks to end the conflict have failed but the UNs special envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday that a crucial moment had been reached in efforts to secure a political settlement. But despite the diplomatic flurry fighting has intensified in Aleppo divided between government forces in the west and rebels in the east since mid-2012. Barrage of shells Rebels fired a barrage of at least 300 shells into western Aleppo killing nine civilians the Observatory said. Ahmed a resident of the government-controlled west of the city said his home in the Syria quarter was completely destroyed. The shells have rained down on the western neighborhoods since 4:30 am he told AFP. Residents lifted debris in the Syria quarter and helped neighbors gather their belongings so they could leave in search of shelter elsewhere. Mahmud Abu Malak a spokesman for the Nureddin al-Zanki rebel group described fierce fighting. All kinds of heavy artillery and machine-guns are being used in the assault which is intended to ease the pressure on the Mallah and Handarat fronts he said referring to areas near the rebel supply route into Aleppo. The Castello Road route was effectively severed last Thursday when government forces seized a hilltop within firing range. The advance leaves the opposition-held east of the city cut off and raises the prospect of total siege. On Sunday at least 29 opposition fighters were killed when rebels launched a fruitless assault to push government forces back from the road and reopen the route. Watch: Regional international diplomats struggle over Aleppo Play Video Meagre food stocks The severing of the Castello Road has already created shortages of food and fuel in the east of Aleppo with local market stalls sparsely stocked. There are very few vegetables today because the Castello Road is closed said Abu Mohamed a vendor in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. If we hadnt planted eggplant and zucchini inside the city we wouldnt have had any vegetables at all he said pointing to his meagre stock of vegetables. Residents also described searching in vain for fuel whether for vehicles or home use. The UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas of the country most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the tactic. The latest violence comes despite an extension until early Tuesday of a nationwide truce declared last week by the government to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. In northwest Idlib province 17 people including two children were killed in air strikes which the Observatory said were carried out by either regime or allied Russian warplanes. US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Moscow this week to seek common ground on how to deal with the ongoing bloodshed it was announced Monday. The current truce does not cover extremists from ISIS or the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. Also Monday ISIS militants entered the historic city of Palmyra in central Syria for the first time since being defeated there by regime forces in March. But they were killed and the attack was now over according to the Observatory.

1926479363,Assad regime responsible for awful Syria chemical attack: EUs Mogherini,Tuesday 4 April 2017 Assad regime responsible for awful Syria chemical attack: EUs Mogherini . EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said Tuesday the regime of Bashar al-Assad bears primary responsibility for a suspected chemical attack that killed at least 58 people in a rebel-held town in Idlib Syria including 11 children under the age of eight on Tuesday. Today the news is awful Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war-monitoring group. This morning at 6:30 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tay yip Eroding and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. US air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where militias have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of US-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that ISIS used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a US-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.,arabiya,4/4/2017,idlib,1,tuesday 4 april 2017 assad regim respons aw syria chemic attack eu mogherini eu diplomat chief federica mogherini said tuesday regim bashar alassad bear primari respons suspect chemic attack kill least 58 peopl rebelheld town idlib syria includ 11 children age eight tuesday today news aw mogherini said interview media organis brussel sidelin euun confer meant focu postconflict situat syria syrian militari sourc strongli deni armi use weapon attack caus mani peopl choke faint foam come mouth syrian observatori human right said cite medic sourc describ sign ga attack air strike town khan sheikhoun south rebelheld idlib also wound 60 peopl said observatori britishbas warmonitor group morn 630 warplan target khan sheikhoun gase believ sarin chlorin said mounzer khalil head idlib health author ad attack kill 50 peopl wound 300 hospit idlib provinc overflow wound peopl told news confer idlib warplan later struck near medic point victim attack treat observatori said civil defenc worker said civil defenc also known white helmet rescu servic oper opposit area syria said jet struck one centr area nearbi medic point would mark deadliest chemic attack syria sinc sarin ga kill hundr civilian ghouta near damascu august 2013 western state said syrian govern respons attack damascu blame rebel militari deni syrian militari sourc tuesday deni alleg govern forc use chemic weapon dismiss account rebel propaganda armi use past futur first place sourc said joint inquiri unit nation global chemic weapon watchdog previous accus govern forc toxic ga attack franc call emerg un secur council meet tuesday suspect attack reuter photograph show peopl breath oxygen mask wear protect suit other carri bodi dead children corps wrap blanket line ground activist northern syria circul pictur social media show purport victim foam around mouth rescu worker hose almost nake children squirm floor town street becom empti wit said conflict pit presid bashar alassad govern help russia iranianback militia wide array rebel group includ support turkey unit state gulf monarchi russian defenc ministri said tuesday russian plane carri air strike idlib syrian russian air strike batter part idlib despit ceasefir turkey russia broker decemb accord observatori turkish presid tay yip erod russian presid vladimir putin discuss suspect attack turkish presidenti sourc said said two leader also emphasis import maintain ceasefir popul balloon idlib provinc contain largest popul area control antiassad rebel nationalist free syrian armi group islamist faction includ former al qaedalink nusra front idlib popul balloon thousand fighter civilian shuttl aleppo citi area around damascu govern retaken recent month us air strike sinc januari also hit sever area rural provinc militia power presenc unit nation organis prohibit chemic weapon investig whether damascu adher commit 2013 agreement avert threat usl militari intervent report octob last year inquiri said govern forc use chemic weapon least three time 20142015 isi use mustard ga 2015 follow 2013 ghouta attack syrian govern join intern chemic weapon convent usrussian deal govern deni forc behind ghouta attack also agre hand declar stockpil 1300 tonn toxic weaponri dismantl chemic weapon program intern supervis damascu repeatedli deni use weapon sixyear war kill hundr thousand creat world worst refuge crisi
1926479371,Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment,November 4 2016 Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment. Ellen Francis Angus McDowall. Syrian rebels and civilians showed no sign of leaving the besieged opposition-held sector of Aleppo on Friday despite a Russian deadline to resume bombing Syrias largest city at nightfall after a 17-day pause. The rebels own shelling of residential parts of government-held western Aleppo has meanwhile killed dozens in the past week as insurgent groups staged a counter-attack from outside the city aimed at breaking the siege on areas they control. The government sent ambulances and buses to bring people out of the besieged zone as it has done at other times during the pause but there was still no sign that anybody would leave. Residents contacted by Reuters seemed resigned to the resumption in bombing which killed hundreds of people in late September and early October as the government and its Russian allies abandoned a ceasefire to launch their assault on the biggest urban area in opposition hands. Nothing can be done. Nobody can stop the planes said Bebars Mishal an official with the white helmets civil defense volunteer group in eastern Aleppo which digs victims out of the rubble and runs an ambulance service. He said there was no way for rescue workers or medical staff to prepare in advance of the expected resumption of attacks: All we can do is take precautions and be ready 24 hours a day. Moscow and Damascus say their pause in bombing the city will end at 7 pm (1700 GMT) accusing rebels of having used the pause to reinforce and launch attacks on government-held areas. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that by around 8:30 pm local time there was no sign yet of resumed aerial bombardment of central parts of the city. The government and its Russian allies say they target only militants and that fighters are to blame for civilian casualties by operating in civilian areas. Western countries say the bombing has deliberately targeted hospitals aid workers and bakeries and Washington has accused Moscow of war crimes. Rebels say the aim is to drive out civilians some 275000 of whom remain in the besieged zone. They call it a ceasefire. The regime hasnt let us hear the end of it said Modar Shekho a nurse in rebel-held eastern Aleppo. As usual when it ends they will let the bombardment loose. Weve gotten used to this. Syrias army backed by Lebanese Iranian and Iraqi Shiite militias and Russias air force launched a major offensive to retake eastern Aleppo from rebel groups on Sept. 22 after a series of advances allowed them to besiege it this summer. Aleppo has become the focal point of fighting in Syrias war now in its sixth year pitting President Bashar al-Assad and his allies against Sunni rebel groups including some supported by Turkey Gulf Arab monarchies and the United States. The city has been divided between the government-held western sector and rebel-held east for years. Winning full control of it would be the biggest victory so far for Assads government in a war that has killed many hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than half of Syrians from their homes. NOBODY WILL LEAVE Damascus and Moscow declared a unilateral four-day pause in strikes on Oct. 18 promising rebels and residents safe passage to leave the city and have extended it for most days since although some attacks have continued. Russia which has brought an additional aircraft carrier to Syrias coast said on Wednesday that all rebels must leave Aleppo by Friday evening adding its moratorium on air strikes could not be extended because of rebel shelling. A witness in western Aleppo at Bustan al-Qasr near a crossing point set up by the government to allow civilians to flee the rebel area told Reuters on Friday he could see people waiting for relatives to come from the east. Buses and ambulances were waiting for them but so far there was no sign of an exodus. A woman at Bustan al-Qasr who was covering her face said she hoped the people in eastern Aleppo would be able to leave safely and peacefully. Rebels have rejected the demand they withdraw. Nobody will leave and the Russians will escalate. The Russians declared this said Zakaria Malahifji a Turkey-based official from the politburo of the Fastaqim group which is present in Aleppo. The opposition says Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies aim to win the war by depopulating rebel-held areas starving the population out or bombing them into flight. The Russians are adopting a policy of demographic change with the regime and Iran and their intentions are no longer hidden an official from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki rebel group said. In recent months other opposition-held areas have surrendered after long army sieges. The government calls the process reconciliation offering safe passage out for rebel fighters who abandon territory and lay down their arms. It has proposed a similar program to end the siege of eastern Aleppo opening what the army calls safe corridors and sending ambulances for injured civilians and green city buses to transport fighters to Idlib a rebel-held area. But so far only a very small number of people have left the rebel-held zone since late October. Damascus has accused rebels of stopping people from leaving including by shelling the safe corridors which rebels have denied. I wish civilians would exit ... but I expect that wont happen not under these circumstances Fadi Ismail an official based in Aleppo in Syrias reconciliation ministry told Reuters via telephone. Ismail said prospects for a deal with rebels looked bleak. There must be military action of course he said if no one evacuated. The United Nations has said it does not have security guarantees needed to deliver aid into eastern Aleppo. It opposes evacuations of civilians from besieged areas unless they are voluntary. After their offensive began in late September pro-government forces managed to take ground in northern Aleppo including a camp for Palestinian refugees and smaller areas in the south but made fewer advances into densely populated areas. Rebels launched a counter-attack a week ago against the western edge of government-held areas from the surrounding countryside. They have made progress in the Dahiyet al-Assad suburb and the 1070 apartment blocks district using 15 suicide car bomb attacks during the week a war monitor said. The Observatory said the rebels had killed 69 civilians including 25 children in shelling during their counter-attack.

1926479378,Syrian Russian jets pound rebel areas,Wednesday 16 November 2016 Syrian Russian jets pound rebel areas. Air strikes pounded neighbourhoods around a childrens hospital and a blood bank in rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Wednesday in a second day of renewed bombing that has killed at least 32 people a war monitor medics and emergency workers said. Russian military planes were seen all night until morning in several regions of Idlib in northwestern Syria said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The regime air force bombed eastern sectors of Aleppo Syrias divided second city Abdel Rahman told AFP. The air raids formed part of a wider military escalation by the Syrian government and allies including Russia which fired coordinated volleys of missiles at rebels on Tuesday and for the first time used its only aircraft carrier. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes on eastern Aleppo on Wednesday alone killed at least 21 people including five children and an emergency worker. They were carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes it said. The Observatory said districts struck included al-Shaar al-Sukkari al-Sakhour and Karam al-Beik. Air raids also continued in the countryside west of Aleppo from which rebels have launched assaults on government-held areas. An attack on the village of Batbo killed at least 19 people including three children the Observatory said. Moscow has denied reports that its jets have hit Aleppo in the renewed wave of bombardment and said it was sticking to a moratorium on air strikes in the city. Tuesdays bombing run on eastern Aleppo appeared to mark the end of a pause inside the city declared by Russia on Oct. 18 which Syrias military had also largely observed. The Observatory and residents said the citys east was hit by rocket fired from jets barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and artillery from government forces. The helicopters wont stop for a single moment Bebars Mishal a civil defence worker in rebel-held Aleppo told Reuters. Right now the bombing wont let up. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of a major operation which saw the first missions carried out by warplanes taking off from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier that arrived off Syria last week. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a moratorium on Russian air strikes against targets in Aleppo remained in place for the time being. In this Oct. 11 2016 file photo provided by the Syrian Civil Defense group known as the White Helmets residents sit amongst rubble in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Syria. (AP) The offensive drew strong condemnation from the United States which said it had received reports of hospitals and clinics being bombed. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that has killed more than 300000 people across the country since it started in March 2011 with anti-government protests. UN condemns Syrian attacks in Aleppo Meanwhile a UN committee has approved a resolution strongly condemning the recent escalation of attacks in Aleppo and continuing violence by the Syrian government against its own people. The General Assemblys human rights committee voted 116-15 with 49 abstentions in favor of the draft resolution on Tuesday. It is virtually certain to be adopted when the assembly votes next month. An injured child waits after receiving treatment at the University hospital in a government-held neighbourhood on November 3 2016 following reported rebel fire on government-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo. (AFP) The draft resolution demands that Syrian authorities immediately put an end to all indiscriminate attacks including those involving the use of terror tactics air strikes barrel and vacuum bombs incendiary weapons chemical weapons and heavy artillery. It deplores and condemns in the strongest terms widespread human rights violations by the Syrian government. The draft calls for a cease-fire by all parties saying this is essential to achieve a political solution. Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month.

1926479384,U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe,Friday 23 August 2013 U.N. chief pushes Syria to allow for chemical attack probe. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday renewed his push for Syria to allow U.N. inspectors immediate access to investigate allegations that the government carried out a deadly chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. I can think of no good reason why any party either government or opposition forces - would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter the U.N. chief told a diplomatic forum in Seoul. Syrias government has offered no public response to U.N. calls for its team to inspect the site of the attack which opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said killed from 500 to well over 1000 people. They said more bodies were being found in the wake of Wednesdays mysterious pre-dawn killer fumes which the Syrian government insists were not its doing. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said it was appalled by the death reports. A U.S. official familiar with initial intelligence assessments said the attack appeared to be the work of the Assad government. It was the regime acting as a regime the official said. But the Obama administration made clear that any response would await confirmation of a chemical attack and its origin. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies laid out on floors with no visible signs of injury. Some had foam at the nose and mouth. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said world powers must respond with force if allegations that Syrias government was responsible for the deadliest chemical attack on civilians in a quarter-century prove true. But Fabius stressed there was no question of sending in troops on the ground. Talk of a forceful foreign response remains unlikely to be translated into rapid concerted action given division between the West and Russia at Wednesdays U.N. Security Council meeting and caution from Washington on Thursday. Moscow has said rebels may have released gas to discredit Assad and urged him to agree to a U.N. inspection. On Wednesday Russian objections to Western pressure on Syria saw the Security Council merely call in vague terms for clarity - a position increasingly frustrated Syrian rebels described as shameful. The State Department said senior U.S. and Russian diplomats would meet in The Hague next Wednesday to discuss ending Syrias civil war in what would be the first such meeting since allegations of the chemical attack. A senior State Department official said chemical weapons would also be discussed at the meeting. The meeting had previously been announced but no date had been released. Ban said he would send a top U.N. disarmament official Angela Kane to lobby the Syrian government in person and expected a swift positive answer. Obama has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to urgently help establish what caused the deaths a State Department spokeswoman said while acknowledging it may be difficult given that the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Syria. At this time right now we are unable to conclusively determine CW (chemical weapons) use the State Departments Jen Psaki told reporters. We are doing everything possible in our power to nail down the facts she added. Another U.S. official said intelligence agencies were not given a deadline and would take the time needed to reach a conclusion with confidence. Former weapons investigators say every hour matters. The longer it takes the easier it is for anybody who has used it to try to cover up said Demetrius Perricos who headed the U.N. team of weapons inspectors in Iraq in the 2000s. People are growing desperate Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. Syrian officials have called allegations against their forces illogical and fabricated. They point to the timing of the attack days after U.N. inspectors arrived after months of argument and to previous assurances that if they possessed chemical weapons they would never use them against Syrians. After months of negotiating with Assads government to let inspectors into Syria a U.N. team arrived in Damascus four days ago. Their task is to check on the presence but not the sources of chemical weapons that are alleged to have been released in three specific small incidents several months ago. Many rebels and activists in the opposition area say they have lost interest in promises of U.N. investigations or in help from abroad: We are 7 km away just a five-minute car ride from where they are staying said activist Bara Abdelrahman.

Qassem Saadeddine a commander and spokesman for the rebels Supreme Military Council said the group was still deliberating on how or if it should respond: People are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and U.N. meetings without any hope of action he told Reuters. Syrias revolt against four decades of Assad family rule has turned into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 100000people in 2-1/2 years and divided the Middle East along largely sectarian lines. Among world powers the conflict has revived Cold War-era East-West tensions and on the ground the struggle has limped to a poisonous stalemate. Assads Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam and has the backing of Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Western powers back the opposition but have been reluctant to fully commit to an Arab Sunni-backed revolt increasing layover taken by Islamists linked to al Qaeda. Yet they have said the large-scale use of widely banned chemical weapons would be a game changer. Syrias southern neighbor Israel still technically at war with Damascus said it believed Syrian forces had used chemical weapons and accused the world of turning a blind eye: The world condemns the world investigates the world pays lip service Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said. In Paris Fabius said that if the Security Council could not make a decision one would have to be taken in other ways but he did not elaborate. Immediate international action is likely to be limited. European officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that options ranging from air strikes creating a no-fly zone or providing heavy weapons to some rebels were all still on the table - but that there was little prospect of concrete measures without U.S. backing which still seemed unlikely. The American reaction following yesterdays attack wascautious said one official. And without U.S. firepower theres little we can do.

1926479389,Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets,August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

At least 60 people have been killed and more than 100 others injured in a car bomb explosion in the Syrian town of al-Rankus north of the capital Damscus. The explosion occurred near al-Sahil Mosque in Rankus some 30 kilometers north of Damascus soon after Friday Prayers. It was not immediately clear who carried out the deadly attack. The Syrian government has not commented on the bombing. The blast happened amid growing tension between militant groups over gaining more share of powers in the controlled areas in several Syrian cities. The Syrian opposition in exile said in a recent statement that the radical militants were trying to ""steal the (alleged) revolution"".

1962495633,Car bomb kills four in Damascus,Thu Sep 5 2013 Car bomb kills four in Damascus. A car bomb has killed four people in the Sumaria area in the Syrian capital Damascus as citizens are bracing for a possible US attack the official Syrian news agency has reported. According to SANA the car bomb caused big flames and damaged surrounding buildings. Four people were killed and 6 were wounded in the attack which happened near the Research and Tests Center affiliated to the Syrian Ministry of Industry. Damascus residents already accustomed to incessant warfare within the Syrian capital were making final preparations this weekend for an attack from outside attempting to anticipate where American missiles might strike. Tensions rose higher in the region after US rushed to dispatch its warships toward Syria threatening to bomb several areas in the country based on conflicting reports of an alleged chemical attack in the country. The US-backed militants posted pictures and videos of an alleged chemical attack which they claimed the Syrian army was responsible for it. The Syrian government which has already called for UN action against several cases of chemical attacks by anti-Syria militants in the country rejected the claims as baseless and paved the way for visiting UN team of inspectors to investigate the story. Syria says the attack was actually carried out by the foreign-backed militants to open way for their Western and regional supporters to attack Syria. Despite killing of at least 100000 people in the massive insurgency in Syria the US had said that it would enter the conflict if a chemical attack was carried out.,alalam,2/2/2011,damascus,0,thu sep 5 2013 car bomb kill four damascu car bomb kill four peopl sumaria area syrian capit damascu citizen brace possibl us attack offici syrian news agenc report accord sana car bomb caus big flame damag surround build four peopl kill 6 wound attack happen near research test center affili syrian ministri industri damascu resid alreadi accustom incess warfar within syrian capit make final prepar weekend attack outsid attempt anticip american missil might strike tension rose higher region us rush dispatch warship toward syria threaten bomb sever area countri base conflict report alleg chemic attack countri usback milit post pictur video alleg chemic attack claim syrian armi respons syrian govern alreadi call un action sever case chemic attack antisyria milit countri reject claim baseless pave way visit un team inspector investig stori syria say attack actual carri foreignback milit open way western region support attack syria despit kill least 100000 peopl massiv insurg syria us said would enter conflict chemic attack carri
1962495634,Saudi-backed rebels behind Syria chemical attack report,Sat Aug 31 2013 Saudi-backed rebels behind Syria chemical attack report. Rebels and local residents in Syrias Ghouta say Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan provided chemical weapons to an al-Qaeda-linked armed group. Interviews with people in Damascus and Ghouta a suburb of the Syrian capital where the humanitarian agency Doctors Without Borders said at least 355 people had died last week from what it believed to be a neurotoxic agent indicated the Saudi-backed militants could be responsible for the recent deadly chemical attack in Syria. The US has been moving its warships closer to Syria russhing to bomb army and government bases based on conflicting reports over an alleged chemical attack in Ghouta near capital Damascus. However from numerous interviews with doctors Ghouta residents militant fighters and their families a different picture emerges the Mint Press News reported. Many of the residents believe that certain militants received chemical weapons via the Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan and were responsible for carrying out the gchemical attack. My son came to me two weeks ago asking what I thought the weapons were that he had been asked to carry said Abu Abdel-Moneim the father of a militant fighting to unseat the Syrian government who lives in Ghouta. Abdel-Moneim said his son and 12 other militants were killed inside of a tunnel used to store weapons provided by a Saudi militant known as Abu Ayesha who was leading a fighting battalion. The father described the weapons as having a tube-like structure while others were like a huge gas bottle. Ghouta townspeople said the militants were using mosques and private houses to sleep while storing their weapons in tunnels. Abdel-Moneim said his son and the others died during the chemical weapons attack. That same day the terrorist Jabhat al-Nusra which is linked to al-Qaeda announced that it would similarly attack civilians in the Syrian government heartland of Latakia on its western coast in purported retaliation. It tell us what these arms were or how to use them complained a female fighter named We didnt know they were chemical weapons. We never imagined they were chemical weapons.When Saudi Prince Bandar gives such weapons to people he must give them to those who know how to handle and use them she warned. She like other Syrians does not want to use their full names for fear of retribution. A well-known militant leader in Ghouta named agreed. Jabhat al-Nusra militants do not cooperate with other militants except with fighting on the ground. They do not share secret information. They merely used some ordinary militants to carry and operate this material he said. We were very curious about these arms. And unfortunately some of the fighters handled the weapons improperly and set off the explosions said. Doctors who treated the chemical weapons attack victims cautioned interviewers to be careful about asking questions regarding who was responsible for the deadly assault. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders added that health workers aiding 3600 patients also reported experiencing similar symptoms including frothing at the mouth respiratory distress convulsions and blurry vision. The group has not been able to independently verify the information. More than a dozen militants interviewed reported that their salaries came from the Saudi government. ,alalam,8/31/2013,damascus,0,sat aug 31 2013 saudiback rebel behind syria chemic attack report rebel local resid syria ghouta say saudi princ bandar bin sultan provid chemic weapon alqaedalink arm group interview peopl damascu ghouta suburb syrian capit humanitarian agenc doctor without border said least 355 peopl die last week believ neurotox agent indic saudiback milit could respons recent deadli chemic attack syria us move warship closer syria russh bomb armi govern base base conflict report alleg chemic attack ghouta near capit damascu howev numer interview doctor ghouta resid milit fighter famili differ pictur emerg mint press news report mani resid believ certain milit receiv chemic weapon via saudi intellig chief princ bandar bin sultan respons carri gchemic attack son came two week ago ask thought weapon ask carri said abu abdelmoneim father milit fight unseat syrian govern live ghouta abdelmoneim said son 12 milit kill insid tunnel use store weapon provid saudi milit known abu ayesha lead fight battalion father describ weapon tubelik structur other like huge ga bottl ghouta townspeopl said milit use mosqu privat hous sleep store weapon tunnel abdelmoneim said son other die chemic weapon attack day terrorist jabhat alnusra link alqaeda announc would similarli attack civilian syrian govern heartland latakia western coast purport retali tell us arm use complain femal fighter name didnt know chemic weapon never imagin chemic weaponswhen saudi princ bandar give weapon peopl must give know handl use warn like syrian want use full name fear retribut wellknown milit leader ghouta name agre jabhat alnusra milit cooper milit except fight ground share secret inform mere use ordinari milit carri oper materi said curiou arm unfortun fighter handl weapon improperli set explos said doctor treat chemic weapon attack victim caution interview care ask question regard respons deadli assault humanitarian group doctor without border ad health worker aid 3600 patient also report experienc similar symptom includ froth mouth respiratori distress convuls blurri vision group abl independ verifi inform dozen milit interview report salari came saudi govern
1962495635,Extremism takes hundreds of lives in Latakia,"Mon Aug 12 2013 Extremism takes hundreds of lives in Latakia. Hundreds of Alawite civilians have brutally been killed kidnapped tortured or have disappeared during a rebel offensive on the province of Latakia local residents have reported. Foreign-backed militants have pushed deep into the coastal city for the first time seizing a string of villages in a campaign which locals have warned threatens to open the area up to full-blown sectarian war. ""We are still finding people who were killed in their homes and bodies left in bushes"" said Sheikh Mohammed Reda Hatem a religious leader in Latakia. ""Until now 150 Alawites from the villages have been kidnapped. There are women and children among them. We have lost all contact with them."" After suffering a string of recent military defeats in the central Syrian province of Homs the militants including al-Qaeda linked-extremists have turned to Latakia. At one point the fighting came within 12 miles of Qardaha where is said to be Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ancestral village. Extremist crimes against Alawite civilians are not new in the foreign-backed insurgency in Syria. At the start of the crisis in 2011 when pro-reform protests was turning to a war by penetration of scores of foreign extremists many Shia-dominated towns and villages witnessed unmerciful killing of many people including children. ""They are provoking a sectarian war. The casualties are in their hundreds and many civilians have been kidnapped including women"" said Dr Ammar al-Assad a Member of Parliament for Latakia. ""Those civilians who were not kidnapped have fled and are hiding in the forests around the villages. The situation is in total chaos. Video footage posted showed rebel groups indiscriminately launching rockets in the direction of Qardaha and many of the comments made in the footage were clearly sectarian. The coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous in recent months were a safe haven for Syrian residents however latest attacks have made many people flee the areas.

1962495638,ISIL terrorists massacre 250 Syrian troops in Raqqa,Thu Aug 28 2014 ISIL terrorists massacre 250 Syrian troops in Raqqa. The notorious ISIL terrorists have brutally massacred 250 Syrian troops taken hostage at an airbase in the northern province of Raqqa reports indicate. The killings the video of which was published on the internet took place on Wednesday at Tabqa airbase which was overran by the ISIL Takfiri terrorists. Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the London-based so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Thursday that Syrian soldiers captured while fleeing after the ISIL terrorists overran Tabqa airbase were executed by the terrorists during the night. The base is located some 45 kilometers outside Raqqa and reportedly holds several planes helicopters tanks and artillery. ISIL militants operating against the Syrian government have committed numerous mass executions during the ongoing conflict. Since the outbreak of crisis in Syria in March 2011 several video clips have been released showing the grisly crimes perpetrated by the Takfiri terrorists against innocent civilians in the crisis-torn country. ISIL terrorists have been behind many of the deadly bomb attacks targeting both civilians and government institutions across Syria over the past three years. The ISIL violence has spilled over to neighboring Iraq. The terrorist group has links with Saudi intelligence and is believed to be indirectly supported by the Israeli regime.

1962495639,ISIL kills 700 people from Syrian tribe,Sun Aug 17 2014 ISIL kills 700 people from Syrian tribe. The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave.

1962495643,Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni,"Tue Oct 7 2014 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed ""Islamic caliphate"". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists ""are trying hard to capture the city"" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. ""We need help from the international community"" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. ""Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us."" IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. ""They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person"" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. ""The strikes hit the Mishtenur area"" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane.""But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting"" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants.

1962495661,21 Civilians Killed in US-Led Coalition Attacks in Northern Syria,Mon Jul 18 2016 21 Civilians Killed in US-Led Coalition Attacks in Northern Syria. Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by the Daesh (ISIS ISIL) Takfiri terrorists a monitoring group says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIS started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIS seized control over territories west and north of the country. The air campaign was later expanded to cover areas in northern Syria despite criticism from the Syrian government that the attacks violate the sovereignty of the Arab country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIS in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The coalition attacks on Manbij intensified in late June after Kurds and Arabs from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance failed in their drive to fully push back militants from the city. The SDF has attempted several times to advance from the western neighborhoods it has captured into the road south of Manbij which connects the strategic city to Raqqa the de facto capital of ISIS in Syria.

1962495673,23 ISIS Terrorists Killed in Turkey US-Led Coalition in Syria Report,Mon Jun 20 2016 23 ISIS Terrorists Killed in Turkey US-Led Coalition in Syria Report. At least 23 ISIS (Daesh) militants have been killed by Turkish artillery fire and US airstrikes in northern Syria a Turkish broadcaster claims. As many as 33 targets were hit in the joint operation which was carried out against militants preparing for an attack on Turkey Haberturk reported on Monday. Cross-border artillery fire by Turkish troops destroyed at least six weapon caches and one armed vehicle it said. The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week Turkey would not allow cooperation with terrorist organizations in Syria referring to Kurdish groups which the US supports. Turkey says the fighters are a terrorist organization affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but the US sees them as a partner in Syria operations. In a speech to his ruling AK Party in parliament last Tuesday Yildirim said Turkey wont allow formation of new states in Syria echoing suspicion that the Kurdish campaign was aimed at establishing a separate state.

1962495675,15 Syrian Civilians 3 Children Killed in Aleppo by US Airstrikes Report,Wed Jun 1 2016 15 Syrian Civilians 3 Children Killed in Aleppo by US Airstrikes Report. At least 15 civilians including three children have been killed in northern Syria in US airstrikes purportedly targeting ISIS positions in the Arab country a report says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Wednesday that the attacks had occurred in the city of Manbij in Aleppo Province during the past 24 hours. The airstrikes came a day after the White house said the US government was following up on press reports about alleged Russian airstrikes in Syria with civilian casualties. The observatory and the Reuters news agency said on Tuesday that at least 23 people had been killed in Russian airstrikes in the militant-held city of Idlib including one near a hospital. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov denied the reports. We urge people to remain critical of any horror stories spread by the British tandem of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Reuters news agency he said. Elsewhere in northern Syria thousands of troops from a Kurdish-Arab alliance are launching an attack to capture from Daesh a crucial swathe of the region known as the Manbij pocket following weeks of quiet preparations US officials told Reuters. The Pentagon has reportedly deployed more than 200 special forces troops alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of Kurdish Arab Assyrian Armenian and Turkmen fighters. The Observatory said that the forces captured16 villages from Daesh and advanced to within nine miles on Manbij. Meanwhile Turkish military forces shelled northern Syria claiming to have targeted positions of the ISIS Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn Arab country. The Turkish General Staff said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 14 members of the terrorist group were killed during the shelling on the city of Aleppo. The state-run Anadolu Agency citing military officials said Wednesday the strikes destroyed a tank two mortar positions a building used as headquarters and three vehicles belonging to the terrorists. The report which could not be independently verified said the air raids came after Turkeys military had determined that Daesh militants were preparing to attack the Turkish territory from the region. Cross-border fire from Syria has claimed 21 lives and wounded dozens of others in the border town of Kilis south central Turkey this year. Turkey itself stands accused of supporting Takfiri militants in Syria. Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and other Takfiri terrorists hold most of the northwestern province of Idlib and parts of neighboring Aleppo province. On Sunday Associated Press said Nusra Front has used a March ceasefire to recruit thousands of militants including teenagers who had used the Turkish border to slip into Syria. It is illustrating how the ceasefire put in place by Russia and the United States to weaken the militants has in many ways backfired the news agency said. Since March Nusra Front has recruited 3000 new militants including teenagers in comparison to an average of 200 to 300 a month before AP quoted SOHR as saying. Other sources said hundreds living in camps for displaced people in the northern parts near Turkey have joined the al-Qaeda branch Press TV reported. 212,alalam,8/16/2012,aleppo,1,wed jun 1 2016 15 syrian civilian 3 children kill aleppo us airstrik report least 15 civilian includ three children kill northern syria us airstrik purportedli target isi posit arab countri report say socal syrian observatori human right sohr said wednesday attack occur citi manbij aleppo provinc past 24 hour airstrik came day white hous said us govern follow press report alleg russian airstrik syria civilian casualti observatori reuter news agenc said tuesday least 23 peopl kill russian airstrik militantheld citi idlib includ one near hospit russian defens ministri spokesman major gener igor konashenkov deni report we urg peopl remain critic horror stori spread british tandem syrian observatori human right reuter news agenc said elsewher northern syria thousand troop kurdisharab allianc launch attack captur daesh crucial swath region known manbij pocket follow week quiet prepar us offici told reuter pentagon reportedli deploy 200 special forc troop alongsid syrian democrat forc sdf coalit kurdish arab assyrian armenian turkmen fighter observatori said forc captured16 villag daesh advanc within nine mile manbij meanwhil turkish militari forc shell northern syria claim target posit isi takfiri terrorist group wartorn arab countri turkish gener staff said statement wednesday least 14 member terrorist group kill shell citi aleppo staterun anadolu agenc cite militari offici said wednesday strike destroy tank two mortar posit build use headquart three vehicl belong terrorist report could independ verifi said air raid came turkey militari determin daesh milit prepar attack turkish territori region crossbord fire syria claim 21 live wound dozen other border town kili south central turkey year turkey stand accus support takfiri milit syria alqaedalink alnusra front takfiri terrorist hold northwestern provinc idlib part neighbor aleppo provinc sunday associ press said nusra front use march ceasefir recruit thousand milit includ teenag use turkish border slip syria illustr ceasefir put place russia unit state weaken milit mani way backfir news agenc said sinc march nusra front recruit 3000 new milit includ teenag comparison averag 200 300 month ap quot sohr say sourc said hundr live camp displac peopl northern part near turkey join alqaeda branch press tv report 212

1962495687,Al-Nusra Al-Qaeda Terrorists Attacks Kill 12 Civilians in Syrias Aleppo Hama,Sun Apr 24 2016 Al-Nusra Al-Qaeda Terrorists Attacks Kill 12 Civilians in Syrias Aleppo Hama. Militants have launched fresh rounds of attacks on civilians and security forces across Syria killing at least 12 and injuring a number of others. The Lebanon-based al-Mayadeen TV said that rounds of shelling by militants on two residential neighborhoods in the northern city of Aleppo left 11 people dead including women and children. The report said the rocket attacks targeted al-Neel Street and the New Aleppo neighborhood saying fatalities came mainly due to the destruction of houses in those areas. Syrias official SANA agency said rocket shells also fell in al-Hamadaniyeh neighborhood of Aleppo inflicting losses on private and public properties. It said the attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra and other armed groups operating inside and near Aleppo. SANA said militants from Nusra and the so-called Ahrar al-Sham group also launched rounds of mortar attacks on al-Sqeilbiyeh city and al-Jaberiyeh village in Hama province again in north Syria killing one civilian and injuring four others. It said four of the shells hit residential neighborhoods while the other 10 fell in the surroundings of the cities and villages located in the northwestern countryside of Hama. The attacks came one day after four residential neighborhoods of Aleppo and two in and around the capital Damascus were targeted by militants leading to four deaths. Syrian officials say the attacks show lack of seriousness in the opposition to respect a truce deal which is currently holding in the Arab country. The ceasefire which was brokered by the United States and Russia in late February was meant to facilitate and ongoing peace talks in Switzerland between the government and the foreign-backed opposition. The deal excludes al-Nusra Front and Daesh. Damascus and militant groups involved in the ceasefire have been trading accusations of truce violation.

1962495698,Twin Bomb Attacks Kill 50 Injure Dozens in Syrias Homs Province,Sun Feb 21 2016 Twin Bomb Attacks Kill 50 Injure Dozens in Syrias Homs Province. At least 50 people have lost their lives and 100 others sustained injuries in twin bomb attacks targeting a residential neighborhood in Syrias western city of Homs. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two vehicles laden with explosives went off within less than a minute of each other at a traffic light at al-Siteen Street in al-Zahraa district of the city located 162 kilometers (101 miles) north of the capital Damascus on Sunday morning. A report by the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll could rise further because of the high number of people seriously wounded in the attacks. No group has claimed responsibility for the act of violence so far but such terrorist attacks are usually carried out by the Takfiri militant groups active in the area. In a similar incident last December more than 30 people were killed and 90 others wounded in two bomb explosions that rocked al-Zahraa neighborhood of Homs. The December attack came after foreign-backed militants began evacuating the last district they were controlling in the city under a deal with Damascus. The new fatal bombings come in the wake of significant army gains against Takfiri terror groups on several fronts particularly the northwestern province of Aleppo near the Turkish border. The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria which flared in March 2011 has claimed the lives of some 470000 people and left 1.9 million injured according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Moreover 6.36 million people have been displaced internally and more than four million others have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict. That accounts for 45 percent of the countrys population which has shrunk by 21 percent.

1962495704,US Coalition Warplanes Kill Tens of Civilians in Syrias Aleppo,"Thu Oct 6 2016 US Coalition Warplanes Kill Tens of Civilians in Syrias Aleppo. The US-led coalitions fighter jets killed at least 60 civilians in Salsana village in the Northeastern parts of Aleppo. According to the Arabic-language desk of Sputnik news agency the US warplanes targeted the residential areas in the village 50km Northeast of Aleppo city and killed over 60 civilians among them several children. Local sources said that a large number of civilians were also wounded in the attacks some of them in critical conditions. Local sources in Deir Ezzor said on Monday that the US airstrikes had destroyed more bridges and supply routes in the province adding that 50 civilians were killed in the attacks. ""50 civilians including women and children were killed in the US-led coalition airstrikes on Deir Ezzor"" the sources said. Noting that the US airstrikes have pounded 7 bridges in the past four days they said that the bridges on the Euphrates in al-Mayadeen al-Bu Kamal al-Ashara al-Basira al-Tarif and al-Nowam in the Eastern and Western countryside of Deir Ezzor were attacked before the airstrike on al-Abbas bridge on Sunday. Army sources in Syria said on Sunday that the US pounded several strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor in the last few days to prevent the army and its allies further advances in the fight against the ISIL terrorists. ""The US aimed to extend the geographical area of its influence by bombing the strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor and stop the Syrian armys advance in the war against the ISIL"" the source told FNA. ""Washington also sought to cut the supply routes between the provinces and separate Deir Ezzors countryside from the city of Deir Ezzor through the bombing"" the source added. ""Destruction of Deir Ezzor bridges was also aimed at dividing the regions under the US and Russian influence in the Eastern and Western parts of the Euphrates"" the source said. The US-led coalition fighter jets once again conducted air raids over Deir Ezzor province on Friday destroying two other key bridges over the Euphrates River just three days after demolishing two other strategic bridges in similar airstrikes in the same region near the border with Iraq. According to reports the Coalitions airstrikes resulted in the destruction of al-Shihan Bridge near al-Salhin neighborhood in al-Bu Kamal countryside and Tarif Bridge in the Western countryside that extends between Deir Ezzor and Raqqa provinces. The US-led coalition warplanes had also destroyed al-Asharah Bridge that links the two banks of the river in the Eastern part of the Deir Ezzor province last Wednesday only few hours after demolishing al-Mayadeen Bridge. The bombers had also targeted the Syrian army troops near the city of Deir Ezzor on September 17 leaving over 90 military personnel dead and a hundred wounded. Russias Defense Ministry confirmed a report by the Syrian state news agency that an ISIS offensive began right after Syrian Army positions were hit by the bombers of the US-led coalition. The actions of the coalition clearly paved the way for ISIL terrorists to attack the position and take control of it the agency said citing the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces. The General Command called the bombing a serious and blatant aggression against Syrian forces and said it was ""conclusive evidence"" that the US and its allies support ISIL terrorist group. A day later a military source disclosed that the ISIS launched attacks on the Syrian army positions in Deir Ezzor only 7 minutes after the US-led coalitions airstrikes. The military source reiterated that the air and ground assault were highly coordinated. A Syrian top official said the countrys intelligence unit possesses an audio recording of a conversation between the ISIL group and the US military before the airstrikes by the US-led coalition on the Syrian army troops near Deir Ezzor on September 17. The speaker of the Peoples Council of Syria Hadiya Khalaf Abbas said that after the US coalitions airstrikes on the government troops US military directed terrorists attack on the Syrian army FNA reported. 219",alalam,10/6/2016,aleppo,1,thu oct 6 2016 us coalit warplan kill ten civilian syria aleppo usl coalit fighter jet kill least 60 civilian salsana villag northeastern part aleppo accord arabiclanguag desk sputnik news agenc us warplan target residenti area villag 50km northeast aleppo citi kill 60 civilian among sever children local sourc said larg number civilian also wound attack critic condit local sourc deir ezzor said monday us airstrik destroy bridg suppli rout provinc ad 50 civilian kill attack 50 civilian includ women children kill usl coalit airstrik deir ezzor sourc said note us airstrik pound 7 bridg past four day said bridg euphrat almayadeen albu kamal alashara albasira altarif alnowam eastern western countrysid deir ezzor attack airstrik alabba bridg sunday armi sourc syria said sunday us pound sever strateg bridg deir ezzor last day prevent armi alli advanc fight isil terrorist us aim extend geograph area influenc bomb strateg bridg deir ezzor stop syrian armi advanc war isil sourc told fna washington also sought cut suppli rout provinc separ deir ezzor countrysid citi deir ezzor bomb sourc ad destruct deir ezzor bridg also aim divid region us russian influenc eastern western part euphrat sourc said usl coalit fighter jet conduct air raid deir ezzor provinc friday destroy two key bridg euphrat river three day demolish two strateg bridg similar airstrik region near border iraq accord report coalit airstrik result destruct alshihan bridg near alsalhin neighborhood albu kamal countrysid tarif bridg western countrysid extend deir ezzor raqqa provinc usl coalit warplan also destroy alasharah bridg link two bank river eastern part deir ezzor provinc last wednesday hour demolish almayadeen bridg bomber also target syrian armi troop near citi deir ezzor septemb 17 leav 90 militari personnel dead hundr wound russia defens ministri confirm report syrian state news agenc isi offens began right syrian armi posit hit bomber usl coalit action coalit clearli pave way isil terrorist attack posit take control agenc said cite gener command armi arm forc gener command call bomb seriou blatant aggress syrian forc said conclus evid us alli support isil terrorist group day later militari sourc disclos isi launch attack syrian armi posit deir ezzor 7 minut usl coalit airstrik militari sourc reiter air ground assault highli coordin syrian top offici said countri intellig unit possess audio record convers isil group us militari airstrik usl coalit syrian armi troop near deir ezzor septemb 17 speaker peopl council syria hadiya khalaf abba said us coalit airstrik govern troop us militari direct terrorist attack syrian armi fna report 219

1962495733,Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112,"Sun Apr 16 2017 Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112. Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as ""hundreds"" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on ""terrorists."" The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt.

The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate.

1965495324,Syria Accuses Rebels of Using Chemical Weapons,"24.08.2013 Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" DAMASCUS Syria (The Associated Press Albert Aji) Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs gas masks vials of an unspecified medication explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts. It did not however show any video of soldiers reportedly affected by toxic gas in the fighting in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus. Still the claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for an alleged gas attack on rebel-held suburbs of the capital on Wednesday that activists say killed more than 130 people. That attack has spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were indeed used. Just hours before the state media reports the UN disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press President Bashar Assads regime to allow UN experts to investigate Wednesdays alleged attack. The Assad regime has denied allegations that it was behind that attack calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government. The US Britain France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. The UN secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane the high representative for disarmament affairs to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesdays purported attack. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday. With the pressure increasing on the regime to comply Syrias state media alleged on Saturday that rebels in the contested district of Jobar had used chemical weapons against government troops advancing into the area. The state news agency said several government troops who took part in an offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists."" ""The Syrian Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason the terrorist groups used chemical weapons as their last card"" the Syrian state TV said. That report was followed by an unusual string of breaking alerts on the TVs news scroll that made a series of claims related to the alleged use of chemical arms by rebels in the Jobar neighborhood. One message cited a Syrian TV journalist who is embedded with the troops in the district who said the army confiscated an arms cache that included gas masks and several barrels with ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on them. It did not say what was in the barrels but appeared to suggest that some sort of chemical agent was inside and supplied by Saudi Arabia the regions Sunni Muslim power and a staunch supporter of Syrias Sunni-led revolt. Another news scroll said that troops after overrunning rebel positions discovered antidotes following exposure to chemical agents. The TV said the medicines were produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar is another strong supporter of the Syrian rebels. The report could not be immediately verified. For days the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used chemical weapons on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack. On Saturday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said dismissed the government line. ""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in Syria near Damascus and that Bashar Assads regime was behind it"" Fabius told reporters during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate. France has suggested that force could be used against Syria if Assads regime was proven to have used chemical arms. The new talk of potential military action in Syria has made an independent investigation by UN inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired. The UN experts already in Syria are tasked with investigating three earlier purported chemical attacks in the country one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons. It took months of negotiations between the UN and Damascus before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into Syria to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites however and it is only charged with determining whether chemical weapons were used not who used them. Syrias Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil told The Associated Press on Thursday that he was personally in favor of a fair transparent international delegation to investigate the latest incident. But he said that would require a new agreement between the government and the United Nations and that the conditions for such a delegation would need to be studied. ... 11 Tags Bashar al-Assad chemical weapons Angela Kane Damascus Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News",sputnik,8/24/2013,damascus,0,24082013 syrian state media accus rebel use chemic arm saturday govern troop tri storm contest neighborhood damascu claim major armi offens recent day forc opposit fighter resort weapon last card damascu syria associ press albert aji syrian state media accus rebel use chemic arm saturday govern troop tri storm contest neighborhood damascu claim major armi offens recent day forc opposit fighter resort weapon last card state tv broadcast imag plastic jug ga mask vial unspecifi medic explos item said seiz rebel hideout howev show video soldier reportedli affect toxic ga fight jobar neighborhood damascu still claim could muddi debat respons alleg ga attack rebelheld suburb capit wednesday activist say kill 130 peopl attack spur demand independ investig renew talk potenti intern militari action chemic weapon inde use hour state media report un disarma chief arriv damascu press presid bashar assad regim allow un expert investig wednesday alleg attack assad regim deni alleg behind attack call absolut baseless suggest attempt discredit govern us britain franc russia urg assad regim rebel fight overthrow cooper unit nation allow team expert alreadi syria look latest purport use chemic agent un secretarygener dispatch angela kane high repres disarma affair push speedi investig wednesday purport attack speak report upon arriv damascu saturday pressur increas regim compli syria state media alleg saturday rebel contest district jobar use chemic weapon govern troop advanc area state news agenc said sever govern troop took part offens experienc sever troubl breath even suffoc arm terrorist group use chemic weapon clear meant suffoc report mention fatal among troop govern refer rebel fight toppl assad terrorist syrian armi achiev major progress past day reason terrorist group use chemic weapon last card syrian state tv said report follow unusu string break alert tv news scroll made seri claim relat alleg use chemic arm rebel jobar neighborhood one messag cite syrian tv journalist embed troop district said armi confisc arm cach includ ga mask sever barrel made saudi arabia stamp say barrel appear suggest sort chemic agent insid suppli saudi arabia region sunni muslim power staunch support syria sunnil revolt anoth news scroll said troop overrun rebel posit discov antidot follow exposur chemic agent tv said medicin produc qatarigerman medic suppli compani qatar anoth strong support syrian rebel report could immedi verifi day govern tri counter rebel alleg regim use chemic weapon civilian rebelheld area eastern damascu argu opposit fighter respons attack saturday french foreign minist laurent fabiu said dismiss govern line inform converg indic chemic massacr syria near damascu bashar assad regim behind fabiu told report visit west bank citi ramallah elabor franc suggest forc could use syria assad regim proven use chemic arm new talk potenti militari action syria made independ investig un inspector critic determin exactli transpir un expert alreadi syria task investig three earlier purport chemic attack countri one villag khan alass outsid northern citi aleppo march well two locat kept secret secur reason took month negoti un damascu agreement struck allow 20member team syria investig mandat limit three site howev charg determin whether chemic weapon use use syria deputi prime minist qadri jamil told associ press thursday person favor fair transpar intern deleg investig latest incid said would requir new agreement govern unit nation condit deleg would need studi 11 tag bashar alassad chemic weapon angela kane damascu commun standardsdiscuss comment via facebookcom via sputnik news
1965495325,Syrian Opposition Claims Poisonous Gas Attack,"21.08.2013Get short URL 0 0 0 Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a ""poisonous gas"" attack that killed dozens of people. BEIRUT August 21 (The Associated Press) Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a ""poisonous gas"" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past. The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Wednesdays chemical weapons attack as baseless. ""They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission"" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that regime forces fired ""rockets with poisonous gas heads"" in the attack that killed ""tens of people."" Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said ""poisonous gas"" was fired in rockets as well as from the air. He added that regime forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting. Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons. Following Wednesdays reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations ""to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible."" It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. ""This is a massacre by chemical weapons"" said Saeed. ""The visit by the UN team is a joke ... Bashar is using the weapons and telling the world that he does not care."" The UN team led by Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom is meant to probe three sites the village of Khan al-Assal just west of the embattled northern city of Aleppo and two other locations which are being kept secret for security reasons. Wednesdays claim of the chemical attack if confirmed would be the most serious report since the March 19 claim of the attack in Khan al-Assal when at least 30 people were reported killed. Assads regime and the rebels have blamed each other for that attack. The unrest in Syria began in March 2011 and later escalated into a civil war. More than 100000 people have been killed in the conflict so far according to the United Nations.

The Russian aircraft carried out 182 airstrikes against the positions of Daesh terrorists in Syria in the past 24 hours the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. A total of 70 Daesh terrorists who were later identified as nationals of CIS states and Algeria were eliminated in the Mayadin area according to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. The airstrikes were carried out after reconnaissance drones had discovered a large stronghold of Daesh terrorists on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river near the city of Mayadin. The terrorists had an artillery and tank projectiles depot as well as a ramified network of underground tunnels there. ""A Daesh command post and three groups of terrorists who arrived in the area from the territory of Iraq as a reinforcement were destroyed. The elimination of 34 militants the destruction of 5 SUVs with large-caliber weapons as well as 2 vehicles with ammunition has been confirmed"" Russian Konashenkov stated commenting on airstrikes near the village of Hatla in the Deir ez-Zor province. The spokesman went on by saying that a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 jet hit the same area 40 minutes later when Daesh militants arrived at the scene to evacuate wounded terrorists. As the result of that strike more militants were eliminated. Sputnik Dmitriy Vinogradov Russian Su-24 Warplane Crashes in Syria All Crew Members Dead Earlier in the day Konashenkov said that the US forces had reduced its anti-Daesh operation in Iraq as the Syria army was conducting an operation to liberate the Deir ez-Zor province from terrorists. The spokesman stressed that foreign mercenaries from Iraq use armored vehicles and pickups with weapons to provide daily replenishment to Daesh troops in the Syrian city of Mayadin.

1965495348,Daesh Executes 128 Civilians in Town for Cooperating with Syrian Government,"23.10.2017(updated 2340 23.10.2017) Get short URL 548 A human rights group has claimed that Daesh executed at least 128 Syrian civilians in the town of Al-Qaryatayn which has been traded between the militant group and the Syrian Arab Army multiple times. The civilians were massacred in reprisal for collaborating with the government of Bashar al-Assad. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the killings occurred over a 20 day period. The Syrian army retook the city in April 2016 after eight months of Daesh occupation. However Daesh chased the government forces out on October 1 but the Syrian army regrouped and returned three weeks later recapturing the city once more with support from Russian airstrikes. But in that three-week period Daesh executed 128 residents of the town which had a population of about 18000 before the civil war started. The Palmyra Coordination Committee a local group that supports protest and resistance against the Syrian government reported that at least 35 of the slain were found with their bodies dumped in a mine shaft. Sputnik Hikmet Durgun US-Led Coalition Confirms Syrias Raqqa Completely Liberated From Daesh ""After the regime retook it [on Saturday] the towns residents found the bodies on the streets. They had been shot dead or executed with knives"" said Rami Abdel Rahman the head of SOHR. ""Most of the [Daesh] fighters who attacked the town a month ago were sleeper cells. They are from the town know the towns residents and who is for or against the regime"" he added. The more human rights groups and government forces search the more corpses they discover. Of the Daesh executioners one resident of the town told the Associated Press ""These are people who dont know God they dont know anything. They killed children and women with knives they beat women broke their arms."" SOHR added that at least 12 residents of the town were killed by government forces after they regained control of Al-Qaryatayn. Sputnik HKMET DURGUN Syrian Democratic Forces Recapture Oil Field in Deir ez-Zor Province Al-Qaryatayn had a large Christian minority but the war has obliterated their population as Daesh goes out of their way to target non-Muslims. Many of the towns Catholic and Orthodox Christian minorities have been abducted or killed or have fled the area reducing the Christian population from 2000 to a few hundred. The ancient oasis town believed to have been populated by people since 1750 BC was used by Daesh to protect the nearby city of Palmyra which they captured in May 2015. After trading hands multiple times the Syrian Army retook Palmyra seemingly for good in March 2017. It is also close to Deir ez-Zor the largest city in eastern Syria and one of Daeshs final strongholds in Syria until last month. Government forces beset the riverside town in September 2017 and have wrested nearly the entire region from Daesh control. ... 48 Related Syrian Army Reportedly Kicks Out Daesh From Suburbs of Qaryatayn Town Turkish Envoy to Russia Ankara Comitted to Ceasefire in Syria Damascus Demands Immediate Withdrawal of Turkish Army From Syria - State Media US Admitting Syrian Militants Use Chemical Weapons Welcome Overdue Corrective The Story of Tactical Beard of Syrian Deir ez-Zor Defense General Zahreddine Tags massacre The Syrian war Syrian Army Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Daesh Rami Abdel Rahman Al-Qaryatayn Deiz ez-Zor Palmyra Syria Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News",sputnik,10/23/2017,deir ezzor,0,23102017updat 2340 23102017 get short url 548 human right group claim daesh execut least 128 syrian civilian town alqaryatayn trade milit group syrian arab armi multipl time civilian massacr repris collabor govern bashar alassad britainbas syrian observatori human right sohr report kill occur 20 day period syrian armi retook citi april 2016 eight month daesh occup howev daesh chase govern forc octob 1 syrian armi regroup return three week later recaptur citi support russian airstrik threeweek period daesh execut 128 resid town popul 18000 civil war start palmyra coordin committe local group support protest resist syrian govern report least 35 slain found bodi dump mine shaft sputnik hikmet durgun usl coalit confirm syria raqqa complet liber daesh regim retook saturday town resid found bodi street shot dead execut knive said rami abdel rahman head sohr daesh fighter attack town month ago sleeper cell town know town resid regim ad human right group govern forc search corps discov daesh execution one resid town told associ press peopl dont know god dont know anyth kill children women knive beat women broke arm sohr ad least 12 resid town kill govern forc regain control alqaryatayn sputnik hkmet durgun syrian democrat forc recaptur oil field deir ezzor provinc alqaryatayn larg christian minor war obliter popul daesh goe way target nonmuslim mani town cathol orthodox christian minor abduct kill fled area reduc christian popul 2000 hundr ancient oasi town believ popul peopl sinc 1750 bc use daesh protect nearbi citi palmyra captur may 2015 trade hand multipl time syrian armi retook palmyra seemingli good march 2017 also close deir ezzor largest citi eastern syria one daesh final stronghold syria last month govern forc beset riversid town septemb 2017 wrest nearli entir region daesh control 48 relat syrian armi reportedli kick daesh suburb qaryatayn town turkish envoy russia ankara comit ceasefir syria damascu demand immedi withdraw turkish armi syria state media us admit syrian milit use chemic weapon welcom overdu correct stori tactic beard syrian deir ezzor defens gener zahreddin tag massacr syrian war syrian armi syrian observatori human right daesh rami abdel rahman alqaryatayn deiz ezzor palmyra syria commun standardsdiscuss comment via facebookcom via sputnik news

Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Raqa. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL.

1965511175,Syrian Forces Foil Raid on Castello Kill 29 Militants,10-07-2016 Syrian Forces Foil Raid on Castello Kill 29 Militants. Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the so-called Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front the latter of which is the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters (yards) of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The Observatory said at least one car had been targeted on the road early Sunday morning adding it was unclear if it was carrying civilians or fighters. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent advances by the Syrian army in the al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo. The army had been attempting to seize Mallah for more than two years as it runs adjacent to the Castello Road the last route militants can use to access districts they control in the second Syrian city. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enables Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. ,manar,7/10/2016,aleppo,1,10072016 syrian forc foil raid castello kill 29 milit nearli 30 foreignsponsor takfiri terrorist kill offens unsuccess launch reopen key suppli rout syrian northern citi aleppo nearli 30 foreignsponsor takfiri terrorist kill offens unsuccess launch reopen key suppli rout syrian northern citi aleppo socal syrian observatori human right announc sunday milit socal faylaq alsham nusra front latter syrian branch alqaeda mount attack recaptur strateg castello road thursday ad syrian armi soldier launch counteroffens kill 29 extremist foil attack attack end road remain complet close said observatori chief rami abdel rahman castello road effect sever syrian forc thursday seiz hilltop within fire rang key suppli rout saturday armi soldier within 500 meter yard road fire vehicl attempt use observatori said least one car target road earli sunday morn ad unclear carri civilian fighter captur castello road came wake recent advanc syrian armi almallah farm area northwest aleppo armi attempt seiz mallah two year run adjac castello road last rout milit use access district control second syrian citi captur mallah farm castello road enabl syrian forc besieg militantheld neighborhood aleppo put within fire rang armi
